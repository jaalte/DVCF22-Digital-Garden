Obsidian is pretty confusing at first so here's some tips on getting around

- Note: Make sure to close this program before unplugging the USB or it'll crash

### [[Unsorted/HORT-110\|Hort class page]]

### The graph
- Get back to it from anywhere with Ctrl+G
- The green dots on the graph are notes for horticulture
- The blue dots are for multiple classes, so some big hort pages, like [[Unsorted/Soil\|Soil]], are blue
- If you ever lose this guide page it's the bright pink one on the graph

#### How to navigate
| Hotkey       | Function                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl+G       | Open the graph view                               |
| Ctrl+O       | Search for file names to open                     |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Search through all the text in the whole notebook |
|              |                                                   |

#### Info
- It calls its notebooks "Vaults," this is a copy of my vault for this semester with all my classes
- It's very hard to separate the classes from eachother so I've just included the whole thing:
	- Horticulture, environmental science, geology, and a humanities class about hell
