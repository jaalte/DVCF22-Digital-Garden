Welcome to our Environmental Science course (BIOSC 170) class. This syllabus provides information
regarding our course this semester. I hope the information here will help you understand what to expect for the
course and give you strategies to succeed. I also provide a tentative outline of the course topics, exams, and
assignments.
Class Description
BIOSC 170 is an introductory course designed to expose students to environmental science. We will
examine human interactions with the environment and their consequences for living and nonliving systems.
Topics may include but are not limited to energy and elemental cycles in ecosystems, evolution, population and
community ecology, biodiversity, human population dynamics, natural resource use, pollution, environmental
degradation, climate change, marine and freshwater resources, and environmental policy.
Course and Student Learning Objectives
Lecture Objectives:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of a broad range of environmental problems, their causes, and their
impact on ecosystems.
2. Explain the relationships among populations, communities, and ecosystems.
3. Describe food webs, the flow of energy and nutrient cycling through ecosystems.
4. Evaluate current threats to biodiversity, discuss the benefits of biodiversity, and describe factors which
preserve and factors which decrease biodiversity.
5. Discuss human population growth and its effects on natural resources.
6. Describe the effects of air and water pollution on the environment and on human health.
7. Describe the importance of energy, soil, water and mineral resources as limiting factors in an ecosystem;
discuss the use and conservation of natural resources.
8. Integrate economic, political, societal and legal concerns with environmental issues.
9. Discuss sustainability, environmental ethics, and environmental justice and how these topics relate to
how we use and conserve our environment.
Required Text
Essential Environment – The Science Behind the Stories. 6th edition. 2019, by Jay Withgott and Matthew
Laposata. (Required). Limited copies to check out for the semester at the DVC library or available to rent/purchase
on Chegg, or for purchase through the DVC Book Center.

Class Goals, Organization, Time Commitment
This course is designed to provide the basic skills and knowledge necessary to engage in biological and
environmental problem solving. My main goal is to provide a basic understanding of living systems, give
information on a multitude of environmental issues that we face, and prepare you to critically examine
environmental issues.
Class participation in our zoom classes (T, 6:00-8:00pm) is extremely important for your success in this course.
Class exams and quizzes focus on material taught in lecture and assigned in your weekly assignments. Online, our
class is organized into weekly modules in Canvas. Modules are meant to be completed in sequential order. By
completing each module and clicking NEXT, you should be able to move through the course smoothly. Each week
will have readings, assignments, lectures, quizzes, etc. This class will cover a diverse set of material.
Modules will be posted weekly on Friday, and all the assignments within each module will typically be due the
following Friday evening, giving you 1 week to work on them.
Late Work: I will accept work up to 24h late for a 20% deduction. After that, you can complete assignments up to
4-days late for half credit. Extensions will only be considered under limited circumstances, as any additional time
given for a particular assignment can put you behind on other upcoming assignments. Stay on top of your work,
and please reach out to me if you are struggling. I am here to help.
 Be present and participate in our weekly online class. Make sure you have a place where you can focus
and mentally be present for the time of our class. Take careful notes and ask lots of questions. Please let
me know when something doesn’t make sense!
 Work to understand the material rather than just go for memorization. It will help you immensely! I want
you to ask questions and try to build a deeper understanding. Come to the optional Zoom office hours to
ask questions, email me, or we can set up a one-on-one Zoom. Please participate however you are
comfortable and let me know when you need help or are struggling!
 Time commitment: Set aside enough time for our class each week to get through the material. You need
to plan to spend ~9 hours each week on this class (this is a 3-unit class) this includes class time, reviewing
your notes, doing assignments and readings. Try to think of it like a part-time job and create and stick to a
schedule.
Instructor Contact
You may reach me through the Canvas Inbox (preferred) or email at rdesilva@dvc.edu. I will do my best to
respond to emails within 24 hours. However, response times will be longer for emails received on weekends (for
me weekends start Friday at 4pm), but I will do my best to respond within 48 hours.
Course Format, Delivery and Organization
This class is taught 100% online. We will have 1 weekly Zoom meeting and all other information will be provided
through Canvas. All course materials, such as the syllabus, assignments, grades, etc. will be posted on Canvas,
which is the course management software used by Diablo Valley College. You are responsible for regularly
checking the Canvas site for course updates.
Exams: We will have three exams over the fall termexams are taken over Zoom during our scheduled class
time with video cameras on (dates for these exams are listed in the schedule). The exams will be a combination
of multiple choice, fill in the blank and written answer.
HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CLASS

 Be active online and participate in the course
 Actively watch/listen to lectures each week
and take notes on the material in an organized
notebook
 After taking notes on lectures, participate in
student/office hours each week: we’ll talk
about class concepts, answer questions,
practice class material
 Complete assignments on timeit can be
difficult to catch up later
 Complete exam reviews well before your exams
and bring your questions to study sessions
 Study class material every weekdon’t wait until
the day before a quiz or exam
 Keep track of deadlines \- have a system for
planning
 Log onto CANVAS frequently to check for course
materials
 Questions are ENCOURAGED at any time via any
contact method (I am here to help)
Technology Requirements and Expectations
Technology requirements: This course is online, so is important that you have the necessary system
requirements for Canvas to operate correctly. Students must have regular access to a Windows or Mac computer
(not just a phone or a tablet) with a reliable highspeed Internet connection and access to the Web. Students
should ALWAYS take quizzes on a laptop or desktop. The app is unreliable on a phone or tablet. Students will also
need access to Microsoft Office (or the comparable free Google suite of products) and Adobe Reader. Please note
that I am unable to help you with technical issues using Canvas. If you run into trouble, there are several online
resources to help you - Canvas Student Guide and DVC’s Online Education page.
Class Policies:
 Withdrawing: If you wish to withdraw from the course, it is your responsibility to do so by the withdrawal
deadline. (Note: If you stop participating in class but fail to officially withdraw, you may still be enrolled
at the end of the summer when grades are assigned. Not sure how to drop a class? Click HERE to learn
how to drop a course.
 Academic integrity: Please read DVC’s Academic Integrity Policy HERE. Each student in this course is
expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam/quiz, completing any assignments, and
completing any work for any points in this course, unless directed otherwise by the instructor. Students
are also expected to abide by all College and Department policies regarding academic integrity and
academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment.
You are responsible for understanding the policy, so please ask questions if there is any doubt!! Students
caught cheating on an assignment or exam will receive zero points for that assignment or exam.
Penalties for academic dishonesty (this includes both cheating and plagiarism) are at the discretion of the
instructor and may include (but are not limited to): receiving a zero on the assignment/exam, a lowered
grade in the course, being reported to the Dean of Student Affairs and, for repeated offenses, possible
suspension/expulsion from the college.
Please also note that ALL work is expected to be in your own words. Students caught cheating or plagiarizing on
an assignment, quiz, or exam will receive zero points for that exam. My expectation is that you will do all work
individually unless directed by me and you will not cut/paste or copy any materials directly from the text book or
any website and submit that work as your own.
Learning disabilities
 Disability Support Services (DSS) are available upon request for students with disabilities. If you have a
disability-related need or are already a DSS student, please let me know as soon as possible so we can
make sure that your needs are met and you get the services to which you are entitled. Please visit DVC
Disability Support Services for more information on accommodations and how to find a DSS Counselor.

 Common Courtesy: It’s important to me that we make our class a safe and comfortable space. Whether
an individual is speaking/ commenting on a discussion topic or asking a question, whether it is the
instructor or a student, others in the class are expected to be respectful and pay attention. If a student is
disruptive to the class or disrespectful to others, that student may be asked to leave those sessions.
Getting Help in this Class:
Class time and office/student hours: Make sure to come to class, practice and review the material. I also
encourage you to use my Zoom office/student hours whenever you need help or would like to go over things from
class. You don’t need an appointment, just drop by. You can also email me questions. I am here to help you
succeed.
Getting Help at DVC:
If you find that you are struggling with anxiety, depression, a family crisis, financial or health issues during
the semester, please reach out to me or connect with DVC’s Student Support System.
A few of the support programs that DVC offers are:
 free and confidential mental health and wellness counseling
 financial aid and emergency loan programs
 food pantry through DVC
 help finding affordable temporary and permanent housing solutions
Student Rights & Responsibilities:
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is designed to protect students from having their
records released to persons or institutions without the student’s written consent. FERPA also provides students
with the right to review their education records to ensure that no inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate
information has been included in their file. For more information on FERPA, please visit page DVC's Student
Privacy Rights. I expect we’ll have a great class; however, if issues arise that disrupt our classroom culture, I may
ask you to conference with me and/or the Dean of Students. Disorderly conduct or any type of harassment are
grounds for removal from the class. To learn more, please read DVC Student Rights & Responsibilities.
