# 1. Academic basics

## Registration

### **Registration Dates**

Each term, you will be assigned a date for when you can begin registering for classes. Class registration dates vary based on several factors, including the completion of this orientation, math and English placement, and an educational plan. The number of units  that you have completed, and other classifications can also affect your registration date .

### **How to Get Priority Registration:** 

-   Complete this 4CD online student orientation  
-   Get your English or ESL and math placements  
-   Develop an educational plan with a counselor  

### **H****ow to Keep Priority Registration:**

### It's simple: Maintain good academic standing!

-   Earn a term and cumulative grade point average of “C” (2.0) or above  
-   Complete  at least  50% of the  units you attempt every term

`"continuing students not on academic or progress probation for two consecutive terms"`

### **Academic** **Alert**

Students who fall below a term or cumulative “C” average (2.0 GPA) are placed on academic alert.

### **Progress Alert**

Students who have enrolled in at least 12 cumulative units are placed on progress alert when the percentage of all units that are not completed reaches or exceeds 50%.   

Simply stated:  You must complete at least half of your classes each term with an average of a “C” or better to stay off academic or progress alert.  

The first time a student's GPA falls below a 2.0 or they don't complete 50% of attempted  units (after completing 12 units), the student will be placed on alert.

### **Academic Standing
The 4CD colleges have **three levels of alert**. Students must complete specified activities at each level of alert in order to be removed from probation. You will learn about your college’s requirements for each level of alert in the College Orientation.   

#### **Level One Alert**
Students  receive a warning and are notified to schedule a meeting with a counselor. Students may be blocked from enrollment in future terms until they have met specific requirements.   

#### **Level Two Alert**
Students are blocked from enrollment in future terms until they have met specific requirements, which may include viewing a video, attending a workshop, taking a quiz, and/or meeting with a counselor to develop a plan for improvement.

#### **Dismissal**  
Students are blocked from enrollment in future terms and are required to complete a request for reinstatement after dismissal, meet with a counselor and develop an educational plan. Students may b e required to stop attending  4CD colleges for a period of time or be limited to the number of units enrolled.
