- Cattail, bull rush, cooper's reed
- Typha Latifolia
	- Typhaceae
- Grows lik an herb
- Dual sexes
	- Has staminate (male) flowers on top
	- Pistillate flowers (Female) on bottom
- One of the best survival plants
	- Found worldwide
	- Every single part of it is edible
	- Pull up from water to get rhizomes
		- Boiled, grated/dried, baked
		- Potato-like
		- Edible year-round
		- Contains more calcium, iron, and potassium than potatoes or rice 
			- Similar to the potato for native americans
		- Rhizomes leak pasty substance, used to caulk leaks in canoes
	- New shoots that come up in the spring
		- Can eat raw or cooked
		- Similar to cucumbre
	- Pollen, in fall, high in protein
		- Harvested by putting bag over top
		- Can be mixed with flour and used for baked goods
		- Low in Vitamin C, however
			- California is historically low in Vitamin C
			- [[Unsorted/Plant Nutrition\|Plant Nutrition]]
	- Stalks are very good for basketweaving
		- Mats, dolls, baskets, shelters
		- Poofy hairs on top of fruits is used as insulation, padding, and tinder
- Can be grown by planting rhizomes
	- Significant [[Unsorted/Humans\|anthropogenic]] spread
	- And large range for natural spread
- Complications
	- Used in water reclaimation projects, because rhizomes are good at absorbing heavy metals from water
		- Such as arsenic
		- Fruits of most plants in contaminated water tend to not be contaminated
			- But roots and stems often are
			- Pollen is safe to collect!
		- Pretty much nowhere in California where water is safe to drink
			- [[Unsorted/Water potability\|Water potability]]
			- [[Unsorted/Foraging\|Foraging]] for cattails is not viable anymore, most water is contaminated and those contaminants get into wild plants


### Could they grow in the creek?
- Likely has runoff from many yards
	- Residential runoff is ~8x more toxic than that coming from farmland
	- By people who don't understand that or read the instructions
	- The water probably comes from street drains in the area
		- Scout it out and find out! 
- "ALL" creeks in CCC are contaminated

### Stubs
- Some trees can produce smog
	- Bind small pieces of particular togethre into large ones that can lodge in lungs
- Turpenoids are released by trees
	- Protect plant leaves from oxidation and pests
