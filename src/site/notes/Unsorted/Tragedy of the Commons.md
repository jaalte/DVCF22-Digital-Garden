## Tragedy of the commons questions  

**1. Common use of a shared resource can sometimes lead to exploitation. What does this  
mean?**  
- When individuals tap that shared resource enough that the resource cannot be replenished
	- When short term self interest takes priority over the common good
	- When an individual taps that resource to benefit themselves, while the negative effects of their use of that resource is distributed to all who use the resource

**2. Renewable resources are no longer renewable if we overuse the resource (e.g.  
remove/harvest the resource faster than it can be replenished.) What strategies can be  
used to prevent “the tragedy of the commons?”**  
- Legislation and self-organization are capable of regulating the exploitation of shared resources for the common good 

**3. The “tragedy of the commons” concept can be applied to many of our commonly-owned natural resources. Besides Hardin’s grazing “commons” Can you think of any other natural resources that are commonly owned? Please list and explain at least 2 examples.**
- Water
	- Water is a required resource for all humans, but despite increased water scarcity, more than 50% of water is used for profit rather than for human and edible-crop consumption
- The atmosphere
	- Nearly all forms of life rely on a stable atmospheric composition, but when profit can be made more readily by burning coal than through renewable methods, the atmosphere is polluted and all organisms are affected
	 
**4. What do you think is the most pressing environmental issue we currently face? Explain  
the issue below (Does this issue relate to the concept of “Tragedy of the commons” why or  
why not?**
- [[Unsorted/Soil#Soil quality decline\|Soil#Soil quality decline]]
	- More profit can be made by repeatedly ploughing fields, sowing the same crop, and supplementing the shortcomings of this technique with copious amounts of fertilizer, pesticides, and most importantly water
		- Alternatives include no-till farming, dry farming, organic farming, and responsible crop rotation
	- This consumes 80% of the water supply of California and is the root cause of local water scarcity
	- Eventually the soil is damaged by this practice to such an extent that it is not profitable to either continue growing crops, or to rejuvenate it, resulting in thousands of acres of infertile land
