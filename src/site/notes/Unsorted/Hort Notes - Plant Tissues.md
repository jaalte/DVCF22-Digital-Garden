# Plant Tissues

3 kinds of tissues
- Dermal
	- Tissue found on outside of plant
		- Not underneath bark
	- Functions
		- Protect plant from injury and water loss
		- 
	- Waxy
		- Prevents water from being lost
	- Do not have chloroplasts
		- Transparent, allows light below
	- Have trichomes
		- Hairs that come out of plant, reflect light, act as thorns, emit scents
		- Produce THC in cannabis
	- Stomata
		- Pores where gas exchange happens
		- Surrounded by guard cells which can open/close the stomata
	- Inside
	- Palisade
- Vascular
	- Xylem
		- Carries water upwards from roots to upper tissue
		- One-way flow
		- Use capilary action, pressure flow, transpirational flow, and root pressure
		- Limitations of xylem tissue determine the
	- Phloem
		- Carrys the food, two-way
		- Reverses seasonally
			- Moves down 
		- Living tissue, transports soluble compounds
	- Lower epidermis
	- Palisade cells
	- Bundle sheath cells
- Ground
	- Parenchyma
		- Bulk of plant tissue
		- Soft part of leaves, fruit pulp, other organs
		- Used for storage and [[Unsorted/Photosynthesis\|photosynthesis]]
		- Examples
			- Area inbetween veins and dermis in carrots
	- Collenchyma
		- Support tissue with irregular cell walls
		- Primary component of structural plants
			- Hemp, cotton
		- Hemicellulose, cellulose, pectic minerals
		- Support, structure, mechanical strength
		- Flexibility to petiole, leaf veins, and stem
		- Found immediately under epidermis
		- Can sometimes contain 
		- Examples
			- Stretchiness of strands of celery
	- Sclerenchyma
		- Support tissue, woody
		- Hardens tissue, found in many plants
		- Make bark, nuts, shells, seed coats

- Dermal
	- Leaf
		- Blade
		- Petiole
			- Stem connecting leaf to branches
		- Leaf primordium
			- Usually become leaves
			- Or flowers if plant is stressed
				- (PANIC)
		- Apical bud
			- Dormant buds on stem that are prepared to grow if the tree is injured
- Vascular
	- Stem
		- Primary trunk of plant
	- Node
		- Where new leaves bud off
		- Trimming of nodes allow botanists to train plants to grow more vertically
	- Internode
		- Space inbetween nodes
		- Length correlated to how healthy the plant is
- Ground
	- Transition zone
		- Dirt should not go above transition zone
		- Not resistant to soil pathogens
	- Muscle, roots
	- Roots
		- Taproot
			- Typically dichots
			- Large central root pillar
		- Lateral root
			- Typically monochots
			- Sideways roots, hold into soil
		- Root cap
			- Secretes lubricant and acids that allow them to drill through rocks
		- Root Apex
		- Root hairs
			- Live 1-3 days
			- Form at the tips of the roots as they're moving into new soil
