Union of 3 organisms
- Plants
- Bacteria
- Fish
	- Koi, goldfish, carp
		- Inedible
		- 60-70F
		- More active in summertime
		- Hardy
		- Koi wish rare markings can be very valuable
	- trout
		- More active in winter
	- catfish 
		- Wont eat at low temperatures
	- Tilapia
		- Illegal 

Have to mediate 3 ecosystems

Bacteria are key

Plants like acidic
Fish and bacteria like alkaline

# Plumbing
- Repeated flushes using sinilar mevhanism to toilets
	- Fills up to roughly 3in below container 


## Filters
Fish need mechanical filter
nitrifying bacteria need surface area: biological filter
clay pebbles
also do physical filtration


Fish nitrate to bacterial nitrite, which nourishes plants


brush filters
	for small solid waste
Feeds dosing tank, ideal place to alter chemistry
	lowers concentration by pre-mixing so it doesnt hurt fish

## beds
#### solid medium
- clay  pebble medium
	- high surface area for bacteria
- can harbor worms and shrimp
- dont require separate foltration apparatus 

#### deep water
4x120 foot racks
modular, 4x2 plates with varying hole spacings
racks migrate down system, sinilar to conveyor belt
foam, they float
lightweight
raised beds are less labor intensive
needs a filtration aparatusg!

high density rafts for propagation pre-production
- can seed many rafts

air stone every apx 60ft for aeration

NFT system, horizontal rods, vertically stack3d

## seeding
germination room, temperaruee controlled
use a vacuum-based device to distribite seeds into apx 400 cell trays
seeding done with hydroponics, not aquaponics

## pest control
aphids
- soap
- acedactrine (neem)

caterpillars
- bti bacteria
	- light spray, kills them from the inskde

## Waste streams
Repurpose, remonetize

- fish waste
	- dehydrate to make solid fish manure
	- worm compost food
	- mineralize it
		- 50% of food minerals makes it to waste
		- Heavily aerated 30 days
		- Concentrated liquid feetilizer
		- 40 120 170
		- Potentially 3x more profitable than the plants themselves
- fish (edible)



If plants are healthy they will not flower, desirable


## Inherently food safe
e coli and salmonella require waem blooded animals to reproduce


roundup kills intestinal microbiome


## History
- [[Unsorted/The Egyptians\|The Egyptians]] used aquaponic farming methods
