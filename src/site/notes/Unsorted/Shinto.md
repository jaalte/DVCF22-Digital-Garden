# Afterlife

### Yomi
- Very similar to [[Class - Roots of Hell/Irkalla\|Irkalla]]

### Japanese buddhist afterlife:
##### Jigoku
- We have several "hell scrolls" which include good literary and visual depictions
- First step: **Meido**
		- 3 Oni (ogre [[Demons\|Demons]]) escort the deceased to Jigoku
- There are several judges
- Must endure many brutal tests
	- Has a sense of progress towards the end:
- Last trial
	- On day 49
	- Soul moves on a road and confronts 6 gateways
	- Not clear where they go, the soul must choose
- Passes along a big frozen river, and onto the next destination
- Many more steps
	- Some go to Tengoku, heaven
	- Most are reincarnated
		- Potentially as yokai if they were evil
		- ...or they just go back to Jigoku

- 16 areas
	- 8 hot
		- Meatier, bloodier
		- Examples
			- Those who kill with no regret
				- Even insects
				- Battle royale
				- Bloody iron claws
				- Demons like to smash people
				- Kill and die countless times
			- 
	- 8 cold
	- Potentially with many subdivisions

- King: [[Class - Roots of Hell/Ruler of Hell\|Lord Enma]]

- Punishment is not eternal
