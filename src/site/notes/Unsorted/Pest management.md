## IPM
- A pest management philosophy that utilizes all suitable pest management techniques and methods to keep pest popiulations below economically injurious levels.
- Each pest management technique must be environmentally sound and compatible with producer objectives.
- A non-static, evolving field
	- New pests and methods are discovered every year
	- Pest/herbicide resistant varieties require new solutions
- Study:
	- 2-4 year degree at a 4y university
	- UC Davis has a program for it

- [[Unsorted/Humans\|Humans]] are only just learning how to apply natural systems to accomplish our goals instead of coming up with novel and potentially problematic solutions ourselves 

###### Cycle
Inspection -> Identification -> Monitoring -> Action -> Evaluation **â®Œ**

- Inspection
	- Discovering new pest outbreaks
- Identification
	- Understanding the pest and plant species involved
		- Recognize seasonal effectiveness of each
		- Understand 
- Monitoring
	- Inspect spread of pest
		- ...on currently-infected plants
		- ...and on previously uninfected plants
	- Recognize the cause of the infection
- Action
	- Decide on a method of pest management to use
		- Varies significantly depending on...
			- ...the pests
			- ...the plants
			- ...available methods and resources
- Evaluation
	- Determine if future action is needed
	- Complete eradication of a pest species is rarely...
		- ...necessary
		- ...desirable
		- ...possible
		- Some damage is unavoidable, within acceptable margins

###### Factors
- Genetic
	- Heirlooms have almost no pest resistance
	- Hybrids have typically been bred to have some pest resistance
- Cultural
	- Reduce pest establishment, reproduction, dispersal, and survival
	- Create favorable environments for plants...
		- ...so that they can better resist pests
			- Healthy plants can defend themselves better
		- Often also favorable for pests specialized for that plant
	- Create unfavorable environments for pests
		- Start the environment cleanly to reduce initial infection
		- Solarize soil before use to destroy propagules
	- Examples in farming
		- Crop rotations
		- Pest-free seed
		- Resistant varieties
		- Burning
		- Mowing
- Behavioral
	- How often you're able to act
- Biological
	- Managing nursery ecology to mitigate pests
- Chemical
	- Beware of phytotoxicity
		- Most compounds are phytotoxic when wet on leaves
			- When they dry, will help
		- Time can vary depending on heat
- Sanitation
	- Eliminate/control:
		- Food/water sources
		- Living space
		- Hiding spots

#### Biological IPM
- [[Unsorted/Midterm hort paper - Biological Pest Management\|Midterm hort paper - Biological Pest Management]]

- Use of an organism to control pests

2 primary types
##### Predatory
- Natural predators of pest species
##### Pathogenic
- Pathogens which infect/kill target pest species

##### Artificial
- Cultural, mechanical, biological, physical, legislative, genetic, miscelaneous
##### Natural
- Physical factors
	- Weather
	- Climate
- Biological factors
	- Competitors
	- Predators
	- Parasitoids
	- Insect pathogens

- Pest populations need to be maintained for predator populations to be maintained.
	- Can result in secondary infections otherwise
	- Be wary of population size cycles
		- When predators over-feed and decimate their food supply, resulting in mass death, followed by resurgence of the prey then the predator
		- [Example vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNoetVLuQg&t=6m33s)

###### Wasps
- Warm temperatures can reduce breeding effectiveness
- Can be recognized in oleander aphids by significantly browner color

###### Ladybugs
- Eat their body weight in aphids daily (~10)
- Apparently can bite!
- Mealybug destroyer
	- Need to be introduced in massive levels (thousands, regularly) in order to get established, not as persistent as other predatory insects

- Harm to [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]]
	- BT Corn is in almost all processed foods
		- Modified to produce the Cry proteins that make [[Unsorted/Bacillus thurigiensis\|Bacillus thurigiensis]] lethal to insects
		- Will take decades of research to definitively determine if Bt corn is harmful to [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]]
	- Evidence for
		- Michelle
			- Creates micro-tears in [[Unsorted/Humans\|human]] digestive tract, weakening immune system
			- Possibly responsible for massive increase in allergies in recent [[Unsorted/Humans\|human]] generations
	- Evidence againstalimentary canal
		- "Other organisms (including [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]], other animals and non-targeted insects) that lack the appropriate receptors in their gut cannot be affected by the _cry_ protein, and therefore are not affected by Bt"

#### Mechanical Pest Management
- Using machinery or other tools to control pests
	- No chemical odors or contamination
	- Deplotment/disposal can be messy
- Types
	- Picking off pests by hand
	- Raking
	- Physical barriers
		- Nets, personal gear, tents, canopies
	- Traps
		- For insects
			- Sticky tape around pots and nursery to trap pests and ants
				- Tanglefoot tape has fibers to trap the legs of insects
			- Ants will use their dead comrades as a bridge across the tape
		- For rodents
			- Lethal/non-lethal
	- Diatemaceous earth
		- Crushed fossilized algae
		- Jagged edges damage insect exoskeletons
			- Good for ants!
	- Soap
		- Insects can't climb up things that have been covered in soapy water


#### Chemical factors
- Nearly all wet IPM compounds are phytotoxic
	- phyto (light) toxic (deadly)
- Pesticides can be used as a last resort
	- Has to be done in a way that is...
		- ...responsible
			- No risk of environmental damage
		- ..legal
			- Beware of wind drift
		- ...necessary
			- Benefits must outweigh the risks
			- Make sure pests are suscptible to the presticide in their current life cycle
	- When used, can kill beneficial insects, making the area more susceptible to subsequent pest infections
		- Takes about 3 years to transition
		- Very tough to manage pests in this time
