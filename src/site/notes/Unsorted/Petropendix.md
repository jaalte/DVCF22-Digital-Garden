### A catalog of different types of [[Unsorted/Rocks\|Rocks]], their components, and their properties

[[Unsorted/Granite\|Granite]]




# Sedimentary rocks
## Clastic sedimentary rocks
- [[Shale\|Shale]]
	- Most common sedimentary rock by far
	- Flaky
	- Very good at preserving fossils
- [[Sandstone\|Sandstone]]
	- 2nd most abundant
	- Typically made of quartz, but can vary
- [[Arkose\|Arkose]]
	- Feldspars, poorly sorted
- [[Greywacke\|Greywacke]]
	- Much finer, but still poorly sorted
- [[Siltstone\|Siltstone]]
- [[Claystone\|Claystone]]


# Metamorphic rocks

##### Foliated metamorphic rocks
- Formed via recrystallization on rocks with different amounts of pressure on each axis
	- Differential stress at continental-continental plate boundaries
- Main types in order of increasing grade:

[[Unsorted/Sedimentary rocks\|Sedimentary rocks]] -> [[Unsorted/Slate\|Slate]] -> [[Unsorted/Phyllite\|Phyllite]] -> [[Unsorted/Schist\|Schist]] -> [[Unsorted/Gneiss\|Gneiss]] -> [[Unsorted/Migmatite\|Migmatite]]
 Order of increasing grade

##### Non-foliated metamorphic rocks
- Form via recrystallization, with even pressure on all sides
-  [[Quartzite\|Quartzite]]
	- Chunky quartz
- [[Marble\|Marble]]
- [[Greenstone\|Greenstone]]
	- Forms when basalt metamorphizes
- [[Serpentinite\|Serpentinite]]
	- 
- [[Hornfels\|Hornfels]]
	- A general name used for contact metamorphic rocks that are nonfoliated and too fine grained for individual minerals to be readily recognized.
	- Protoliths such as shale is baked by the intense heat from the intrusion of magma body and metamorphosed into hornfels. 
	- Contact Aureole refers to the zone of intense metamorphism immediately surrounding the magma body.
- [[Amphibolite\|Amphibolite]]
	- Primarily made of amphibole (hornblende)


#### Other
- [[Wollastonite\|Wollastonite]]
	- Combination of Quartz and Calcite
	- Releases CO<sub>2</sub> in the process




# Organic rocks
### Organic sedimentary rocks:
- [[Lignite\|Lignite]]
	- "Soft brown coal"
- [[Bituminous\|Bituminous]]
	- "Soft black coal"

### Organic metamorphic rocks:
- [[Anthracite\|Anthracite]]
	- "Hard black coal"
