-   What is the approximate global population? Is this growth slowing? Speeding up? Is it projected to level off anytime soon? If so, when?
-   In terms of slowing population growth, what are our best weapons?
	-   Please discuss at least 3 different things we can focus on which would help slow the current human population growth (What works?)
	-   For the topics you discuss, please list the difficulties that might be associated with each approach.

1. 
	- Soon to pass 8 billion
	- Starting to slow down, currently at turning point
	- Expected to level off by 2100
		- ...around when population hits 11 billion
2. 
	- Work to increase child survival rates in developing regions
		- Reduces the need for legislative solutions like the one-child policy
	- Ensure women in developing regions have access to primary and secondary education
		- Some regions have cultural dogmas that restrict womens' access to education, such as Afghanistan under Taliban governance.
		- Education about sustainable family planning can also help, but family planning can't be done reliably with high infant mortality rates.
	- Raise awareness
		- Talk about these first two solutions on social media, and raise awareness about the oncoming dangers of overpopulation
