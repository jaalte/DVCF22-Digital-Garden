### Laundry-to-landscape systems
- Greywater reclamation
- Washing machine goes to a 3-way pump which lets you decide whether it goes 
- Things that help it work
	- Best if it's by an outside wall
	- Pipe can't go downhill
		- Can be circumvented with a solar pump, but is questionably legal since standng greywater can be food for bacteria, and contaminate the clean water in the house (potentially also the local water distribution pipes)
- Cut hole in wall, pipe output water into wall, then next to an air vent, out to a distribution system for the outside
- Substances that can't be used
	- Tide detergent (borax-based)
	- Bleach
- Alternative substances
	- Soap nuts
