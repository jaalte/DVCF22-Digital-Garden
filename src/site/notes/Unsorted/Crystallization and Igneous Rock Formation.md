## [[Unsorted/Magma\|Magma]]: Parent material
- As magma chambers cool, igneous rocks form from cooling magma
- Different types of rocks form from lava

Freezing (Crystallization):
700-1200Â°C


Magma contains solids, liquids, gas (volatailes)
- Mainly water, CO2
- Precipitated metals?



## Extrusive and Intrusive igneous rocks

#### Extrusive
- Formed by the cooling of lava on the surface
- AKA Volcanic
	- Careful, can be confusing!
	- Quiz question: "Which of these rocks is volcanic?"

### Intrusive
- Formed by the cooling of magma underground
- AKA Plutonic
- From a distance looks very homogenous
	- But up close it's full of very 
- Examples
	- Mount Rushmore is made entirely of intrusive igneous rock
	- The sierra nevada mountains
		- Including Yellowstone

## The cooling process
- Cooling rate is determined by:
	- Depth
		- Surface rocks are
	- Shape
	- [[Unsorted/groundwater\|Groundwater]]
		- Acts as a heatsink and coolant (if it moves, not sure if it does?)
- Heavily influenced by Surface-area-to-volume ratio
- Standard thermodynamics
- It takes about 1 million years to form a cubic-centimeter sized grain


## Classification of igneous rocks


| Composition  | Fine texture | Coarse texture | Composition                     |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Cooling:** | Fast         | Slow           | ---                             |
| Felsic       | Rhyolite     | Granite        | **Fel**dspars + **si**lica      |
| Intermediate | Andesite     | Diorite        |                                 |
| Mafic        | Basalt       | Gabbro         | >45% **Ma**gnesium + **f**errum |
| Ultramafic   | Komatiite    | Peridotite     |                                 |


### Composition
- What types of minerals are present?
- What proportion are they in?

### Texture
- The overall appearance of a rock based on the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains
- Factors:
	- Rate of cooling
		- Takes about 1 million years to form a cubic-centimeter sized grain
	- Silica content
		- Silica makes magma more viscous and sticky ^silica_runny
		- More explosive eruptions
	- Gas content
		- Primarily water and CO2
			- Water makes magma runny, and facilitates 
		- Coarser textures
		- Varying grain size
		- More violent eruptions


| Textures             | Characteristics                         | Formation                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phaneritic           | Coarse grains                           | Slow cooling                                                         |
| Pegmatitic (subtype) | Unusually large crystals, varying sizes | Slow cooling, low viscosity                                          |
| Aphanitic            | Small grains                            | Rapid cooling                                                        |
| Porphyritic          | Small and large grains                  | Intrusive rocks being erupted, then re-cooled within extrusive magma |
| Glassy               | Smooth, shiny                           | Extremely fast cooling, high viscosity                               |
| Vesicular (holey)    | Porous, contains voids                  | Gas escaping during formation                                        |
| Pyroclastic          | Fine grains but with chunks             | Other rocks being trapped in rock                                    |

Notes
- Vesicular
	- Pumice (light), scoria (dark)
	- Forms slowly, so the inside also contains voids,
