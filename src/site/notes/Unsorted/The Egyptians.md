# Egypt 

- Originated around 3100BC

## The Nile River
- The geographic center of Egypt
- Desert a mile or two beyond the river
- Nile delta to the North is was very swampy, less habitable than today
- Has insulated Egypt from the rest of the world
	- Which brought about peace and stability
		- Much higher standard of living
		- Longer lasting than Mesoptamia
		- Resulted in their religious ideas being much more developed
		- Egyptian culture survived from roughly 3000BCE to 1000BCE

## Culture
- Egypt was much more gender-equitable than the majority of the world
	- Potentially because one of their primary gods, [[Isis\|Isis]], is female

## Religion

### The Afterlife
- Unclear whether there is an afterlife for non-pharoahs
- Notion of afterlife spreads from upper class to peasants
	- Democratizes notion of an afterlife, and more people believe they will experience it
- Very *physical* afterlife
	- Human remains are strongly connected with their notion of the afterlife
- The realm: [[Class - Roots of Hell/Punishing afterlife\|Duat]]
	- Subregion for worthy souls known as Sekhet Aaru
		- "The field of reeds"
		- Unclear if it's an underworld or some place to the far far East, where the sun rises
		- Very similar to the nile region
		- Still farms, animals, etc
			- Also dangerous creatures
				- Possible to die? Unknown
		- Full of all the people who were deemed worthy, presumably pretty chill
		- Activities
			- Working
				- Still have to survive like in the overworld
				- Have access to to tools, items, trinkets in their tomb
				- Helped out by the inclusion of Shabti(s)
					- In Sekhet Aaru, shabtis become your servants/slaves to do work for you
					- SIDENOTE
						- It'd be pretty cool if the physical features of the shabti influenced their physical traits
						- IE extra arms, being bigger, or being attractive 
			- Eating, drinking, socializing, sex
	- Life just doesn't stop when you die

#### Components of their notion of a [[Unsorted/Soul\|Soul]]
- Ka (Life force)
- Ba (Second self, soul)
	- Usually represented as a bird with human head
	- Will often return to burial site
		- Why there's many [[Class - Roots of Hell/Grave goods\|items of amusement]] in tombs
			- They *can* take their prized posessions with them
			- Need to eat and drink in afterlife, so food is available
				- Involved the "opening of the mouth" ceremony
				- Otherwise they won't be able to eat/drink
		- Needs to be sure it's found the right body
			- So they mummify bodies to maintain the integrity of their bodies
			- Funeral masks and sargophagi have faces that resemble the person's face
		- They leave false doors, carved into the walls, for the Ba to enter the world through
- Akh
	- A fusion of the Ka and Ba
		- Only if certain rituals are preformed
	- Still has some contact with the living world
		- Stop disputes, cause nightmares, sickness, guilt

#### The process of going to the afterlife
- Die
	- Death occurs when your [[Unsorted/Soul\|ka]] (life force) leaves your body
	- Mummification
	- Opening of the mouth
	- Burial
	- Duat's 12 gates
		- [[Unsorted/Common features of Hell#The big 6\|Common features of Hell#The big 6]]
		- Each has a gatekeeper, watcher, and herald
		- Figures are monstrous with animal heads
			- Very specific names, IE "Blood drinker who comes from the slaughterhouse"
		- To pass, they must identify the names and titles of each person
			- [[Unsorted/Religious texts\|The book of the dead]] is a collection of spells/prayers to guide people through the underworld
	- Weighing of the heart (AKA feather weighing ceremony)
		- Done by [[Unsorted/Psychopomp\|Anubis]], Jackal-headed god of mummification and protector of the dead
			- A friendly god, AKA a [[Unsorted/Psychopomp\|Psychopomp]]

## Examples

</div></div>

		- Resembles a courtroom scene
		- First solid instance of a sorted afterlife
		- The deceased's heart is weighed against the divine feather of Ma'at
			- The feather is a symbol of justice, truth, balance
