- The mayans had a rich religious life
	- But information is very fragmented due to [[European\|European]] influence and colonization
		- In the pursuit of spreading [[Unsorted/Christianity\|Christianity]], as much information about their traditions was destroyed as possible

				- Bloody teath
				- Skull scepter
		- At the lowest level is a death god
			- Yum Cimil (AKA Ah Puch)
