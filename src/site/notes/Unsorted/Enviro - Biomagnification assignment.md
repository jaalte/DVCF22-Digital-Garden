### Assignment: Biomagnification and Food Chains  

*The first set of questions is based on the article: Mercury-Laden Fog May Be Poisoning [[Unsorted/California\|California]]â€™s  
Mountain Lions*  

1. Where does mercury pollution come from in the Pacific Ocean off the CA coast? How does this biologically inactive mercury convert to the dangerous form, methylmercury?  
> Through (unspecified) natural processes, and human activities, namely mining and coal burning
2. According to the article, what health effects does mercury have on mammals like mountain lions?  
> It causes neurological and reproductive damage
3. Create (draw by hand or use your computer keys to create arrows) to show the food chain described in this article. Be specific about what the primary producer discussed in this article is. Label each level of the food chain with BOTH the organism described by the article and the name of that level of the food chain.
> Lichen (Primary producers) -> Deer (Primary consumers) -> Pumas (Secondary consumers)
4. According to the article, how much can mercury concentrations increase in this system from the primary producer to the mountain lions?
> Up to 1000 times, suggesting that mountain lions are tertiary consumers
5. Explain what bioaccumulation is. How does biomagnification work and how does it differ from bioaccumulation?
> - Bioaccumulation of toxins occurs when an animal consumes more of a toxic substance than it is able to naturally dispose of
> 	- This tends to happen with substances that linger in fatty tissue, such as mercury and DDT
> - Biomagnification occurs when these toxins propagate up the food chain through the consumption of organisms which contain these toxins
> 	- Because of the ~90% energy loss in trophic relationships, nutrient requirements, amount of organisms consumed, and thus amount of toxin consumed, increase by roughly an order of magnitude for each layer of the food chain
> 	- This results in large predators consuming much more of these toxins than their bodies are able to naturally dispose of, AKA bioaccumulation

*The second set of questions is based on the article: Killer Whales Are Most Toxic Arctic Animals*  

1. What chemicals did the researchers look for in the orcas? Where do these chemicals originate and how do they get to the Arctic?
> - polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, and brominated flame-retardants
> - Used in industrialized nations, typically in electronics manufacturing
> - Air and ocean currents carry them northward to the Arctic
2. How was the data collected (how did they get samples from the orcas)?
> Specialized 'guns' that remove a sample of fatty tissue from the outer blubber 
3. What are the two most toxic animals in the Arctic?
> Orcas and polar bears
4. Explain why toxin levels in these two species, in particular, are higher than in other Arctic species.
> Because they are top predators, those toxins bioaccumulate in their blubber.
5. How can these toxins transfer from one generation to the next in marine mammals?
> Orcas feed their young with milk, which is primarily produced using the same fatty tissue that these toxins accumulate in. The young orcas may experience major developmental problems because of this.
6. What kinds of effects do these toxins have on these animals?
> They affect the hormonal system and reproductive capabilities.
