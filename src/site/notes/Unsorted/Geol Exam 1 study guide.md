**Chapter 1. An Introduction to Geology**

Lecture 1. Introduction & Scientific Method

- What is the scientifically accepted age of the Earth?
- Earth is a dynamic body with four separate but interacting parts or spheres – atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere and hydrosphere. Give an example of how changes in one of the spheres may affect the other spheres. 

Lecture 3. Earth Origin & Rock Cycle

- What is a rock?

- What were the two main heat sources for early Earth?
- Describe the processes that led to earth’s iron-rich core.
- List and briefly describe Earth’s compositional divisions.

- What is the age of the oldest seafloor recovered by deep-ocean drilling?
- Compare and contrast the lithosphere and the asthenosphere.

Lecture 5. Tectonic Boundaries and Models

- List the three types of plate boundaries and describe the relative motion at each of them.
- Where does new lithosphere form? Where is it consumed?
- What is seafloor spreading? Where is active seafloor spreading occurring today?
- What is the oceanic ridge system?
- What is continental rifting? Where can we see this process occurring today?
- What are the three types of convergent plate boundaries? What geologic features/processes are associated with each type?
- Compare a continental volcanic arc and a volcanic island arc.
- When two oceanic plates converge, which one will subduct and why? 
- Why does oceanic lithosphere subduct while continental lithosphere does not?
- Briefly describe how mountain systems like the Himalayas are formed.
- Briefly explain why middle of the ocean is not the deepest part of the ocean.
- With which of the three types of plate boundaries are the following places or features associated: Himalayas, Aleutian Islands, Red Sea, Andes Mountains, San Andreas Fault, Iceland, Mount St. Helens? Review Lecture Activity 5 for this.
- What is the supporting evidence for the theory of plate tectonics?
- What is a mantle plume? What is a hot spot volcanism?
- Describe slab pull and ridge push. Which of these forces appears to contribute the more to plate motion?



**Chapter 3. Matter & Minerals**

Lecture 6. Atoms, Bonds and Minerals

- Why are minerals important?
- What is a mineral? List five characteristics of a mineral.
- What is an atom?
- What are protons, neutrons and electrons?
- What is atomic number? What is atomic mass?
- What are isotopes?
- Why do atoms bond? What is the octet rules?
- Explain the differences between ionic, covalent and metallic bonding.
- What is a crystal?
- What are polymorphs?
- Describe three ways a mineral might form (crystallize).

Lecture 7. Mineral Properties and Groups

- Why might it be difficult to identify a mineral by its color?
- Know the definition of mineral properties -luster, streak, cleavage and fracture.
- How is cleavage different from fracture and what does it tell us about minerals?
- How do we determine hardness of a mineral? Be ready to determine hardness of a mineral using common items with known hardness. 
- What are the two most helpful mineral properties that we can use to identify/distinguish calcite from other similar looking minerals?
- What are polymorphs?
- On what basis are minerals placed in mineral classes?
- What are the eight most common elements in Earth’s crust?
- What is the most common mineral group and why is it important?
- Review the silicate mineral structures with example minerals (refer to the handout).
- What are the two most abundant minerals in the continental crust?



**Chapter 4. Igneous Rocks and Intrusive Activity**

Lecture 8. Crystallization & Igneous Rocks

- Why are igneous rocks important?
- How is lava differ from magma?
- Compare and contrast extrusive (volcanic) and intrusive (plutonic) igneous rocks.
- How are light-colored igneous rocks differ in composition from dark-colored igneous rocks?
- What are the four basic compositional groups of igneous rocks and what are they based on?
- How does the rate of cooling influence the texture of igneous rocks? Be ready to identify igneous rocks based on textures and infer cooling history. Review Lecture Activity 8 for this.
- What are the two criteria geologists use to classify igneous rocks?

Lecture 9. Origin & Evolution of Magma

- Why is mantle mostly solid? 
- What are the three different ways that magma can be generated?
- Describe decompression melting. In which tectonic setting does this process occur?
- How does the introduction of volatiles (water) trigger melting? In which tectonic setting does this process occur?
- What is heat-transfer melting and where does it occur?
- What is Bowen's reaction series and why is this concept important?
- What is magmatic differentiation? How might this process lead to the formation of several different igneous rocks from a single magma? Review Lecture Activity 9 for this.
- What is partial melting?
- In what tectonic setting are most basaltic magmas generated?
- Why are rocks of intermediate (andesitic) and felsic (granitic) composition generally not found in the ocean basins?
- Describe each of the intrusive igneous structures – dike, sill, batholith, laccolith, and xenolith.
