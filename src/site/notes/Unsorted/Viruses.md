## Viruses are an atypical form of [[Unsorted/Life\|life]] which does not perform most biological processes, instead relying on the biological processes of [[Unsorted/Life\|organisms]] to achieve similar results

- The only natural source of horizontal gene transfer between different [[Unsorted/Species\|Species]] that can only reproduce sexually, not asexually


### Similarities with cellular [[Unsorted/Life\|life]]:
- Genetic material
	- Based on either DNA or RNA
	- Capable of...
		- ...being replicated by host cells
		- ...coding for the proteins necessary to make more viruses
		- ...mutation, [[Unsorted/Biodiversity\|genetic diversity]], and [[Unsorted/Evolution\|evolution]]
- Proteins
	- Used to make capsids to protect viral genomes when outside of host cells
	- Used to make receptors which are necessary to infect new host cells

### Biological processes not performed:

- Growth
	- Self-repair
- Osmoregulation
- Reaction to stimuli
- Metabolism


# Role as a pathogen
- Covid
- Influenza
