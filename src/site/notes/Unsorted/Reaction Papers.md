- The "Design Your Own Hell" Project!   Congratulations, you have been granted divine powers to administer cosmic justice (for this week only)!  This assignment requires you to articulate your own version of Hell, with a list of (at least 9 types of) wrongdoers and the appropriate punishments that you think should be inflicted on them.  This should be your own 'take' on these things, and wrongdoing can be defined in any way that you choose (e.g., people who cut you off in traffic, Dodger fans, serial killers, etc.).  You should put (at least) as much effort into this as you would a normal Reaction Paper, but **the more specific details the better, and illustrations are esp. welcome**.   One good recommendation for this project is to make an organizational hierarchy; that is, make the list of wrongdoers/punishments go from the least serious to the most serious (or vice versa).

OPTION #2:  Hell as an ‘assault on the senses’---3rd in a series.  One of the very common attributes found in the punishing afterlives of different cultures is a terrible tastes and bad food.  Please describe/recount the worst taste/food you have experienced in your life and the context in which you experienced it (and again, if you want, indicate what kind of wrongdoers you think could/should experience that taste/food in a ‘Hell’).

	The worst tastes I've ever experienced have all been experienced at the dentist. From the bitter-yet-pungent topical numbing gel, to the musty aura of UV-activated tooth resin, to the overwhelming and overwhelmingly unpleasant tooth polishes and fluoride solutions allegedly flavored to taste like "fruit." The dentist's office is home to many, many unpleasant flavors.
	I think such awful tastes would make more-than-fitting punishments for the people who are responsible for most unpleasant trips to the dentist: Executives of processed food companies, especially of candy. They spend their lives crafting new ways to peddle their sweet-tasting processed foods to the masses, resulting in millions of people experiencing far more bitter tastes. It's only fitting that they are forced to experience the worst of both extremes.
	Perhaps they should be force-fed disgustingly sweet corn syrup until their teeth crumble into cavitated husks, then choke on tastes ten times as foul as the bitterest numbing agent, and finished off with the most potent "strawberry" fluoride gel known to man. All before their teeth painfully grow back and the process starts anew. Since dentists are also known for their scraping hooks, those would also be appropriate additions. I'm sure there's at least a couple dentists in the 7th circle with malicious intent and poor accuracy that they could borrow for this purpose.
