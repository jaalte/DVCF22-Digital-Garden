- Writing about how companies have improved technology to combat climate change




In this article, *Should We Be More Optimistic About Fighting Climate Change*, Chen argues that we would be better off focusing on the eco-friendly technological advances that have been made in the last few decades, and that we shouldn't focus on the narrative that "...if we don't dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade, there will be dire consequences to our health and way of life." (Chen, 309). However, advances in technology do not address the root causes of climate change: The burning of fossil fuels and the emission of carbon dioxide by large companies. She even praises the efforts of Royal Dutch Shell, the world's largest oil company, for "looking into renewables and energy efficiency in transportation" (Chen, 313), when ultimately Shell is directly responsible for a very large portion of greenhouse gas emissions, and merely "looking into" alternatives is just a sign that they don't plan to stop burning fossil fuels any time soon. Articles like this protect the root causes of climate change, and are completely counterproductive.

"Even Royal Dutch Shell, the largest oil company in the world, is responding to shareholder pressure by looking to renewables and energy efficiency in transportation" (Chen, 313)

"...if we don't dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade, there will be dire consequences to our health and way of life." (Chen, 309)
