[[Unsorted/Climate change\|Climate change]]

# Climate is the long-term average of [[Weather\|Weather]] in a given place

- Develops over course of decades to centuries
	- Defined by the average temp and precipitation
	- also by type, frequency, duration, and intensity of weather events (heat waves, cold spells, storms, floods, and droughts)

## [[Weather\|Weather]]
Behavior of the [[Unsorted/Atmosphere\|Atmosphere]]
> [!Weather]+
> The state of the atmosphere at any given time or place over the short term – minutes, hours, days.

- Normal weather:
	- Temperature
	- Precipitation
	- Clouds
	- Wind
- Severe weather:
	- Hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and droughts



# Types

## Mediterranean climate
- Only 5% of land area on earth
	- California is one of the driest mediterranean climate areas on earth
- Gets winter rains instead of summer rains
- All environments with mediterranean climates are [[Unsorted/Wildfires\|Pyrogenic]]
	- ...which means their [[Unsorted/Ecosystems\|Ecosystems]] are adapted to and expect [[Unsorted/Wildfires\|fire]]
	- Many plants require the presence of smoke to germinate
- Also prone to [[Unsorted/Natural Disasters#Flooding\|flooding]], since they tend to be coastal regions, and have floodplains
- Tend to have fewer chill hours than other regions





## Features
- Chill hours
- How many hours a day are <40°F (4.5°C)
- Many [[Unsorted/Plants\|Plants]] react selectively to number of chill hours
	- IE apples need a certain amount to fruit
		- Compounds are produced during chill hours that weaken fruit coverings that inhibit growth and ripening
	- 500 total hours
