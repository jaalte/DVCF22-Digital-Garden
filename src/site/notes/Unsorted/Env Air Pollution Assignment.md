Article #1 -
-   In a sentence or two, briefly summarize the article. 
	- This article describes an attempt by lobbyists to change the way pollution-related deaths are calculated in order to skew policy opinions about fossil fuels.
-   What is particulate matter (PM) and why is it dangerous for human health?
	- Particulate matter is a type of air pollutant made from lightweight solid material suspended in the air
	- It has been linked with many respiratory failures and deaths.
-   Scientists often say that PM standards are like speed limits. What does this mean?
	- When driving below the speed limit, the risk of an accident is still greater than zero
	- There is no safely-allowable concentration of particulate matter
-   The Trump administration is seeking to alter the current way in which PM effects are calculated, and how the effects on human health are quantified. The proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule would slightly increase the efficiency of some coal fired power plants, but also would allow older, less efficient plants to remain in place for a longer period of time which would effectively increase PM. Trump's proposed plan also eliminates the so-called "co-benefits" of reduced PM (and lives saved) of our current Obama-era Clean Energy Plan. **Do you consider this a good trade off? That is, do the benefits of Trump's slightly increased coal-power plant efficiency outweigh the risks to human health?** 
	- It is not a good trade-off
	- We need to wean off of fossil fuel combustion - ESPECIALLY coal - as soon as possible, in order to keep the atmosphere breathable and at a livable temperature

Article #2 - 

-   In a sentence or two, briefly summarize the article.
	- This article describes an attempt by lobbyists to loosen regulations about mercury emissions from American industry
-   What is mercury? How does it get released into the environment? What are the health risks for human health?
	- Mercury is the only pure metal that is a liquid at room temperature
	- It gets released into the environment as a side effect of coal combustion
	- It causes brain damage, and lingers in fatty brain tissues leading to bioaccumulation
		- It even causes brain damage to babies that aren't born yet
-   _"The weakening of the mercury rule would be one of the most significant regulatory rollbacks engineered by the Trump administration. The existing federal regulation on mercury pollution, completed in 2012, is the most expensive clean air regulation ever written by the E.P.A."_ Again and again, we see our current government's consistent choice of economic gain over human health. **What SHOULD the role of our government be when it comes to industry standards and public health?**
	- If the government exists to facilitate the will and well being of its people, then its role should be to reduce emissions at all costs
	- The policies and attitudes demonstrated by the modern American government are indicative that they are acting to facilitate profit of American corporations, at the expense of the well being of its citizens
