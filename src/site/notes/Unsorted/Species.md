## A species is a group of organisms which are capable of exchanging genetic material within their population through sexual reproduction
- Does not apply to asexual organisms

### New species are created through [[Unsorted/Evolution\|Speciation]]

# Classification

##### Morphological species
- Classification of organisms by their morphological traits
- But [[Unsorted/Evolution\|Convergent evolution]] frequently breaks those boundaries
	- IE sharks and dolphins

##### Biological Species Concept
- Criteria
	- Able to mate
		- ...and produce fertile offspring
- Caveats
	- Difficult to test
		- Populations in very different 
		- K-selected species take a very long time to give results
			- Have to wait for TWO generations, to know if their offspring are fertile
	- Doesn't apply to asexual species
	- Can have very fuzzy lines
		- Very frequently distinct species are discovered to be one
			- Especially in plants

##### Genetic Species Concept
- Using DNA evidence to determine the relations between species and populations
- Most accurate so far, and applies to asexual organisms

# Speciation

</div>


# Speciation
- A lineage-splitting event that produces two or more separate species
- Occurs when gene flow ends between populations
	- Happens when one or more forms of isolation increase to the point that they do not mate
- Can be caused by any heritable variation that influences reproduction

# Invasive species
- A species that has been brought to a new habitat
	- AKA NIPS
		- Spread rapidly, typically r-selected
		- Have few natural predators
			- Outcompete native organisms in similar niches
- Effects
	- Contribute to more than half of [[Unsorted/Ecological conservation\|threatened or endangered]] species in the US
		- Native species have no natural defenses against invasive predators
	- >$100B losses in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and maintenance
- Causes
	- Plants
		- Non-native plants escaping from gardens
		- Plants being introduced by governments
	- Animals
		- Released pets
		- Sea creatures hitchiking in ballast water of ships
- Factors in development
	1. Introduction
		- Transportation of propagules to a new region
	2. Increasing population
		- Abiotic factors control the success of an invasive species in a new habitat 
		- Generalist species are capable of spreading more easily than specialized species
	3. Outcompeting/displacing native organisms
	4. Lack of natural predators leads to their growth being unregulated...
	   - ...while the carrying capacity of native species decreases due to composition
- Methods of patrol
	- Prevention through...
		- ...education
		- ...public awareness
		- ...preventing introduction
	- Eradication
		- Mechanical, chemical, burning
	- Containment
	- Chemical and [[Class - Horticulture/Hort project ideas\|Biological control]]
	- Restoration of landscape


## Types

- Plants
	- Can severely alter ecosystems because they are primary producers
	- Change food sources of native species
	- Alter soil chemistry or structure
	- Change fire frequency
	- Change insect pollination
- Predators
	- Native prey have little to no defenses against introduced predators


- Examples:
	- California plants:
		- Iceplant
			- Originally introduced to help stabilize coastal cliffsides...
				- ...because it like sandy soil...
				- ...though it has a weak root system
		- Eucalyptus
			- Covered in extremely flammable oil
				- Poisons the ground to deter competitors from growing around it
			- Partially responsible for increased wildfires
			- Introduced to make railroad ties
		- English ivy
			- Garden escapee
		- Vinca
			- Poisonous nightshade
		- Black mustard
		- Star thistle
		- Pampasgrass
			- Takes up space but does not contribute to local ecosystem
	- Worldwide
		- Brown tree snake
			- Introduced to Guam in 1950s, no natural predators
			- Large population boom
			- Wiped out nearly all native forest birds
			- Now threatens Hawaii
