- [[Unsorted/groundwater\|Groundwater]] tends to be safe to drink
- Very little of the water in California is naturally potable
	- Metal contaminants
	- Pathogens
		- Primarily due to cow dung running off into the water

- Water purification systems
	- Wastewater goes into a series of ponds to be filtered
		- First pond is full of cattails (don't eat!)
		- Other potential phases
			- Water mint

- Composting systems
	- Should be built ~10m away from drinking water sources



- Reclaimed water (at least from Concord) is high in Nitrogen
	- Works well as fertilizer, but kills CA native plants
