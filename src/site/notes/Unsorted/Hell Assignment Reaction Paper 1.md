>  Identify a specific idea, or symbol, or motif do you feel is most obviously connected to general ideas of Hell in the popular imagination today.  Why do you think that idea (or symbol, or motif) is so closely associated with the idea of Hell?   What does that say about the broad characterization and popular understanding of Hell?


One of the least subtle common elements of hell in nearly all modern depictions is the color red. It's closely related to fire - which I think is the single most common motif of hell - though even in depictions where fire is not present, the landscape is dominated by red rocks, red skies, and red beings.
I did an image search for "hell" to survey how prevalent it is. The first image which did not prominently feature the color red was a depiction of a frozen hell, with craggy white mountains and a cool blue glow. This image was 13 rows down (roughly the 90th hit).
I think it's so prevalent because the color red is very closely tied to our psychology. In almost all languages, the linguistic origin of the word for "red" significantly predates that of "green," or "blue." In most of these cases, the word for red was used to describe all hues, including greens and blues, for hundreds of years.
It may have even contributed to popularizing the fire motif. The intense blooms of an artist's depiction of fire portray many strong emotions.
Red is the primary color associated with anger, romance, power, danger, and excitement. It's no coincidence that these are all things that are commonly associated with hell.
