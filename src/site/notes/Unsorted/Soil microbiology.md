- Fertile soils have lots of microorganisms
- Biological fertility is [[Unsorted/The Scientific Method\|understudied]]
- Soil microbes are essential to [[Unsorted/Biogeochemical cycles\|Nutrient cycles]]
- Agricultural production ha sfailed to promote healthy soil microbiomes
- Research is currently being done on the restoration and promotion of healthy microbiomes


## 3 kinds of fertility:
- Physical fertility
	- Physical properties of the soil
		- Structure
		- Texture
		- Water absorption and holding capacity
		- Root penetration
- Chemical fertility
	- Chemical properties of the soil
		- Nutrient levels
		- Acidity
		- Alkalinity
		- Salinity
	- Examples
		- Soil has - charge, which prevents + nutrients from being washed away
		- - ions surround roots, creating a charge gradient that pulls +ions out of roots
		- Plants extract cations in [[Unsorted/Photosynthesis\|Photosynthesis]] by trading for H+ via cation exchange
		- Cation exchange is enhanced by root [[Unsorted/Respiration\|Respiration]]
- Biological fertility
	- The [[Unsorted/Ecosystems\|Ecosystems]] of organisms that live in the soil and interact with other components
	- Live on soil, organic matter, or other soil organisms
	- Perform many vital processes in the soil
		- [[Ecosystem services\|Ecosystem services]]?
	- Most complex, and least understood
	- Rich diversity of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and algae
		- Form interactive microbial [[Unsorted/Communities\|communities]]



## Biological fertility
- Organisms
	- Bacteria
		- 100 million to 1 billion bacteria in 
	- Actinomycetes
		- Considered the missing evolutionary link between bacteria and fungi
		- More in common with bacteria, but look like fungi
		- Gives soil its characteristic smell
		- The source of several therapeutic medicines
	- Fungi
		- Groups of fibrous strings called hyphae
		- Can be helpful or harmful
			- Break down nutrients that other organisms cannot
			- Can get food from roots as parasites
		- Roles
			- Communication
				- Carry communication via chemicals and electrons from one plant to another
			- Decomposers
				- Convert dead organic matter into fungal biomass
			- [[Unsorted/Communities\|Mutualists]]
				- Bring soil nutrients to roots in exchange for glucose
			- Parasites
				- Cause reduced production or death
	- Algae
		- 100-10000 per gram of soil
		- Roles
			- Maintain soil fertility
				- Especially in tropical soil
			- Add organic matter when they die
			- Bind soil particles - prevents [[Unsorted/Earth#Erosion\|erosion]]
			- Increases water retention
			- Liberates large quantities of oxygen from the soil
	- Protozoa
		- Much larger: 10k-100k per gram
		- Feed on and ingest soil bacteria
		- Have been used as biological IPM components
	- Viruses
		- Significantly influence soil ecology
			- Can transfer genes between hosts
		- Very understudied
			- Studies being conducted in viral diversity
			- Soils harbor many novel viral species
	- Nematodes
		- 50 microns diameter, 1mm length
		- Responsible for plant diseases
		- 4 categories based on diets
			- Bacteria, fungi, --, --
		- Like sandy soil, hate clay
- Essential for soil health and quality
- Most need food, water, and oxygen
	- Most are aerobic
		- 75% found in top 5cm of soil
		- Also why their populations have been depleted by agriculture


## Remediation
- Agricultural soils are considered to be under threat in many areas
	- But we've gotten better recently
- Soil can be innoculated with beneficial microbes if the conditions are righr
	- But generally, have the right conditions and the microbes will come
