- [ ] ##### Assignments<br>- [ ] Minute paper 3
- [ ] Minute paper 4<br>Q1. 3 different lines of evidence used by Wagner to support continental drift hypothesis<br><br>    1. Continental fit - Comparing locations of mountain ranges, and seeing how well the continents fit together when considering that much of the coastlines will have been eroded since they were together<br><br>    2. Paleoclimates - Evidence of glaciers with similar rock composition spread across now-far-separated regions<br><br>    3. Fossil evidence - Evidence of tropical plant/animal fossils being found in desert areas, and vice versa. Same species discovered in extremely distant regions, where it's very unlikely they would have been able to swim<br><br>Q2. What are lithosphere and asthenosphere<br><br>-   The lithosphere consists of the Earth's crust and the uppermost portions of the mantle. It is sturdy, solid rock.<br>-   The asthenosphere is below the lithosphere, in the upper mantle. It is comprised of softer rock near its melting point
