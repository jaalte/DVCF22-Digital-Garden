- [ ] W14.1 @{2022-11-22} [[Unsorted/Earthquakes\|Earthquakes]]<br>1.  Compare and contrast the richter scale and moment magnitude scale<br>	- Richter<br>		- Based on the amount of shaking/displacement<br>		- Exponential scale, log10<br>		- First to measure, easiest to communicate, but not the whole picture<br>	- Moment-magnitude<br>		- Average displacement and rupture area<br>		- Based on dimensions of the fault, displacement, and rock strength<br>2. Briefly describe at least 3 different earthquake-generated hazards<br>    - Structural collapse<br>	    - Can be mitigated with quake-resistant building designs, and choice of more sturdy building locations<br>    - Fires<br>	    - Caused by rupturing gas lines<br>	    - Difficult to fight because water lines for firefighting will often rupture as well<br>    - Tsunamis<br>	    - Originate from oceanic Mega-thrust faults<br>	    - Cause extreme damage, can displace millions
- [ ] W13.2 @{2022-11-17} [[Unsorted/Earthquakes\|Earthquakes]]<br>1.  Describe the major differences among three types of seismic waves<br>	- P-waves (Primary)<br>		- Moves along the direction of travel<br>		- Waves of compression and decompression<br>		- Fastest type of wave<br>		- Travel through solid and liquid<br>	- S-waves (Secondary)<br>		- Moves up/down along the direction of travel<br>		- Second fastest<br>		- Can't travel through water<br>	- Surface waves<br>		- Travel along the surface<br>		- 2 types: Love and Rayleigh<br>		- Slowest type<br>		- Most destructive type<br>2. Explain how a seismograph/seismometer works. What features are measurable?<br>    - They use the inertia of a weight, and the leverage of a long arm to accurately record minute movements of the Earth<br>	    - So precise that they can detect walking, cars, and ocean waves as noise<br>    - Can measure the time-delay between P-waves and S-waves to determine distance<br>	    - Used to triangulate the epicenter<br>    - Can measure amplitude of each type of wave
- [ ] W13.1 @{2022-11-15} [[Unsorted/Faults\|Faults]] [[Unsorted/Geologic mapping\|Geologic mapping]]<br>1.  How is a joint different from a fault?<br>	- Faults are made of many joints<br>		- Typically, most joints in a fault will be the same type, and the fault will be classified as that type by extension<br>2.  Compare and contrast normal and reverse faults<br>    - Normal<br>	    - Occur at divergent plate boundaries<br>	    - The hanging wall slides down relative to the footwall<br>	    - Is made possible by decrease in horizontal compressive forces due to tension forces<br>	    - Results in horizontal expansion<br>    - Reverse<br>	    - Occur at convergent plate boundaries<br>	    - The hanging wall is pushed up relative to the footwall<br>	    - Is made possible by increase in horizontal compressive forces<br>	    - Results in horizontal compression
- [ ] W12.2 @{2022-11-08} [[Unsorted/Geological dating\|Geological dating]]<br>1.  Rock sample hsa 1500 aroms of parent and 4500 atoms of daughter. Half life of parent is 1.25By<br>	- Ratio: 1500:4500 -> 1:3<br>		- Based on ratio, 2 half-lives have elapsed<br>	- 2 * 1.25by = **2.5 billion years old**<br>2. Why is radiometric dating not used ot determine the age of sedimentary rocks?<br>    - Radiometric dating determines time since the initial formation of the material that makes up a sample<br>	    - So it's only really useful for igneous rocks and fossils<br>    - It can determine the absolute age of the grains that make up the sedimentary rock, but it can't determine when the sedimentary rock itself formed<br>    - The main way of estimating absolute age for sedimentary rocks is to estimate the age of surrounding igneous features
- [ ] W11.4 @{2022-11-03} [[Unsorted/Geological dating\|Geological dating]]<br>1.  What is an unconformity? Explain the 3 types.<br>	- A temporal gap in the geologic record<br>	- Types<br>		- Angular, where underlying strata have been tilted or warped, while upper strata are flat<br>		- Nonconformity, Where sedimentary rocks are built up on top of layers of igneous rock, or igneous rock forms beneath it<br>		- Disconformity, when there's an unconformity between two parallel sets of sedimentary strata<br>2. What is Faunal Succession? Explain why it's important.<br>    - Using fossil evidence to infer what time period sedimentary rocks formed  in<br>    - Index fossils, which have to be very common and occur over a short window of time, are best used for this<br>    - Can be used to do relative age dating between very distant rock formations
- [ ] W10.2 @{2022-10-25} [[Unsorted/Metamorphic rocks\|Metamorphic rocks]]<br>1.  Distinguish between contact metamorphism and regional metamorphism. What metamorphic rocks form at each setting?<br>	- Contact metamorphism<br>		- Primarily heat-driven, not much pressure<br>		- Forms non-foliated metamorphic rocks<br>		- Occurs near magma chambers at relatively shallow depths<br>	- Regional metamorphism<br>		- Collision zone metamorphism<br>			- Driven by heat and *differential* pressure<br>			- Where nearly all foliated metamorphic rocks are formed<br>		- Subduction zone metamorphism<br>			- Occurs at subduction zones<br>			- Creates unique rock types, such as blueschist<br>2. Describe the changes that occur in the transformation of slate to phyllite to schist and then to gneiss<br>    - Slate<br>	    - Forms from low-grade metamorphosis of sedimentary rocks with small grain sizes<br>    - Phyllite<br>	    - Forms from continued metamorphosis of slate<br>	    - Still low-grade<br>	    - Results in a wavier texture<br>    - Schist<br>	    - Forms from partial melting of Phyllite<br>	    - Mafic and felsic minerals slightly separate<br>	    - Intermediate-grade<br>    - Gneiss<br>	    - Forms from nearly complete melting of schist<br>	    - Felsic materials completely melt, while mafic minerals partially melt<br>	    - Results in very sharp light/dark banding
- [ ] W9.4 @{2022-10-20} [[Unsorted/Metamorphic rocks\|Metamorphic rocks]]<br>1.  Compare and contrast confining pressure and differential stress relating to metamorphic rocks. What will happen to the mineral crystals in each situation?<br>	- Confining Pressure<br>		- Crystals aren't skewed<br>		- Creates dense rocks<br>	- Differential stress<br>		- Crystals are elongated<br>		- Creates relatively less dense rocks<br>	- In either case:<br>		- ...Crystals can increase in size if temperature is high enough<br>2. What role does heat play in creating new minerals or in the creation of new crystalline structure sin metamorphic rocks?<br>    - Heat weakens the bonds within minerals, allowing their components to shift to different positions within voids in the crystal structure <br>    -This causes grain sizes to increase
- [ ] W8.4 @{2022-10-13} [[Unsorted/Sedimentary rocks\|Sedimentary rocks]]<br>1.  Explain how the size, shape, and sorting of sediments can provide information about the distance a sediment has traveled from its source<br>	- Size<br>		- Larger particles are sorted out along the length of the river, so:<br>			- Smaller particles have traveled far<br>			- Larger particles haven't traveled as far<br>	- Shape<br>		- Angular rocks have their edges rounded out due to physical weathering of the water, so:<br>			- Angular rocks haven't traveled as far<br>			- Rounded rocks have traveled further<br>	- Sorting<br>		- Clastic sediment becomes more uniform as larger chunks are left behind in the river, so:<br>			- Poorly-sorted rocks haven't traveled as far<br>			- Well-sorted rocks have traveled far<br>2. Explain the 3 categories of sedimentary rock, and provide an example for each<br>    - Clastic sedimentary rock<br>	    - Formed from physical chunks of sediment, which have been weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified<br>	    - Example: Claystone<br>    - Chemical sedimentary rock<br>	    - Formed from the precipitation of dissolved ions from water<br>	    - Example: Limestone<br>    - Biological sedimentary rock<br>	    - Rich in organic carbon<br>	    - Formed from ancient plant remains<br>	    - Example: Lignite coal
- [ ] ## W8.2 @{2022-10-11} [[Unsorted/Soil\|Soil]]<br>1. What is the relationship between texture and porosity of soil?<br>	- Soils with larger particulate sizes will have larger gaps (pores) between individual particles<br>		- ...which influences water penetration<br>2. What are the 5 factors that control soil formation?<br>	- Climate, parent material, time, biological activity, and topography<br>3. Which factor is most influential in soil formation and why?<br>	- Climate, which is a combination of temperature and precipitation<br>		- Higher temperature and precipitation increases chemical weathering<br>		- Lower precipitation decreases chemical weathering ^soil
- [ ] ## W7.4 @{2022-10-06} [[Unsorted/Weathering\|Weathering]]<br>1. Define physical and chemical weathering. How do they differ?<br>	- Physical weathering is weathering that occurs due to mechanical processes breaking down rocks<br>		- Doesn't need water for all of its processes, but it helps<br>	- Chemical weathering is weathering that occurs due to chemical processes breaking down rocks<br>		- Requires water to happen<br>2. How does climate affect rate of weathering?<br>	- Warm/wet climates are prone to much faster chemical weathering<br>	- Cool/dry climates experience little chemical weathering<br>		- But they do experience some physical weathering, such as frost wedging
- [ ] ## W7.2 @{2022-10-04} [[Unsorted/Volcanism\|Volcanism]]<br><br>1. How do geologists determine if a volcano may erupt soon? Explain at least 3 different methods:<br>	- Deformation of the volcano's surface<br>		- Can be measured in many ways, such as lasers, satellites, and electronic levels to detect changes in slope<br>		- Indicates an increase in pressure in the magma chamber<br>	- Emission of gas<br>		- Changes in gas composition can indicate an increase in magma chamber pressure<br>		- Depending on composition, can be a hazard in and of itself<br>	- Measuring seismic activity<br>		- Volcanic activity causes many small tremors to happen in relatively quick succession<br>		- Magma chamber causes subterranean rock to settle, resulting in tremors<br><br>2. Compare and contrast volcanism at divergent and convergent plate boundaries:<br>	- Divergent plate boundary volcanism:<br>		- Typically much more mild<br>			- Even though there's more volcanic activity<br>			- Because eruptions are mostly basaltic<br>				- So they're far less explosive<br>		- Convergent plate boundary volcanism:<br>			- Typically more explosive<br>			- Magma produced at convergent plate boundaries contains much more silica<br>				- Rhyolitic eruptions are much more explosive
- [ ] ## W6.4 @{2022-09-29} [[Unsorted/Volcanism\|Volcanoes]]<br>1. Explain three factors that affect the viscosity of magma. What makes volcanoes explosive?<br>	- Factors:<br>		- Temperature<br>			- Low temp ↑<br>			- High temp  ↓<br>		- Volatiles<br>			- More volatiles ↑<br>			- Less volatiles ↓<br>		- Silica<br>			- Felsic ↑<br>			- Mafic ↓<br>			- Silica content significantly influences temperature, which is also a factor<br>				- Felsic cooler, Mafic hotter<br>	- Felsic (Rhyolitic) magma results in more explosive eruptions because it is much more viscous<br><br><br>2. Compare and contrast the three main types of volcanoes (size, composition, and eruptive style)<br>	- Shield volcano<br>		- Dome-shaped<br>		- Formed when basaltic (runny) magma repeatedly builds upon the surface of the dome, increasing its size and diameter<br>		- Largest by far<br>		- Caldera or crater on top<br>	- Cinder cones<br>		- Cone-shaped volcanoes with large anti-conical depressions at the summit<br>	- Stratovolcano<br>		- Interbedded lava flows and layers of pyroclastic debris<br>		- Conical, exponential curve up towards center<br>		- Typically made of andesitic lava<br>			- But can turn more felsic over time
- [ ] ## W5.2 @{2022-09-20} [[Unsorted/Magma\|Magma]]<br><br>1. Explain the three different ways that magma can be generated<br>   - Decompression<br>      - Melting point is lowered when pressure is reduced<br>   - Addition of water<br>      - When H₂O diffuses into rock, it drastically decreases its melting point<br>      - Tends to occur when oceanic plates are subducted<br>   - Heat-transfer melting<br>      - When solid material around the sides of a magma column fracture and melt from the heat being transfered up from lower in the mantle<br>      - AKA Assimilation<br><br>1. What is magmatic differentiation? How might this process lead to the formation of several different igneous rocks from a single magma?<br>   - Because different minerals have different crystallization temperatures, some will crystalize much sooner than others, changing the elemental composition of the magma<br>   - Ultramafic and mafic rocks crystallize first, causing the magma to lose most of its iron and magnesium<br>      - So the remaining magma will only be able to form intermediate and felsic rocks once it cools to the temperature that those minerals can crystallize at<br>   - AKA Bowden's reaction series
- [ ] ## W4.4 @{2022-09-15} [[Unsorted/Crystallization and Igneous Rock Formation\|Crystallization and Igneous Rock Formation]]<br>1. How do light-colored igneous rocks differ from dark-colored igneous rocks?<br>	-   Light colored rocks have a **felsic** composition<br>	    -   fel-sic: feldspar and silica<br>	-   Dark-colored rocks have a **mafic** composition<br>	    -   ma-fic: magnesium and ferrum (iron)<br><br>2. How does the rate of cooling influence the texture of igneous rocks?<br>	-   The faster an igneous rock cools, the smaller the grains<br>	-   This is because when the rock cools quickly, crystals have much less time to grow<br>	    -   **Extrusive** igneous rock<br>	-   When the rock cools slowly underground, crystals can take millions of years to grow larger<br>	    -   **Intrusive** igneous rocks
- [ ] ## W3.2 @{2022-09-06} [[Unsorted/Plate Tectonics\|Plate Tectonics]]<br>1. List the three types of plate boundaries and describe the relative motion of each of them<br>	- Divergent plate boundaries <- -><br>		- They move away from eachother, IE mid-ocean ridges<br>	- Convergent plate boundaries -> <-<br>		- They move towards eachother<br>		- Potentially causes subduction of oceanic plates<br>	- Transform plate boundaries ⇆<br>		- Where plates shear against eachother<br>		- Rare, often happen along divergent plate boundaries <br><br>2. Describe slab pull and ridge push. In which plate boundary setting does each occur?<br>	- Slab pull<br>	  - The force exerted on the mantle by divergent plate boundaries<br>	- Ridge push<br>	  - The force exerted on the mantle by convergent plate boundaries<br>	- These forces direct convection currents in the mantle
