## Main types
- Bending
- Breaking
- Tilting
- Squashing
- Stretching
- Shearing

## Structures created by deformation
- Folds
	- Layers bent by slow plastic flow
- Faults
	- Fractures that are offset
- Joints
	- Fractures that have no offset
- Foliation
	- Planar metamorphic rock

## Components
- Translation
	- Change in lotation
- Rotation
	- Change in orientation
- Distortion
	- Change in shape
	- Typically a combination of the other two

## Factors

#### Stress
- force per unit area
	- Depends on magnitude of force and area it's applied upon

3 Types:
###### Compression
- Squeezing/shortening
- Convergent plate boundaries
###### Tension
- Pulling apart / stretching
- Divergent plate boundaries
###### Shear
- Sliding and tearing
- Transform plate boundaries


## Types 

#### Elastic
- Recoverable change to the shape
	- If stress is removed, materials will return to original shape
- All solid materials have a maximum elasticity
	- Elastic limit / strength
	- Responsible for earthquakes

#### Brittle
- Objects break by fracturing

#### Ductile
- Permanent changes in shape


## Factors 2

## Boundaries

#### Shapes
- Syncline (sinks, u-shaped)
- Anticline (protrudes, n-shaped)
