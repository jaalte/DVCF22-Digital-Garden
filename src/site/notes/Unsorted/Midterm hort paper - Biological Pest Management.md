## Abstract

#### Introduction

Pest activity causes up to 40% reduction in agricultural yields yearly.1 To mitigate this damage, the agricultural industry performs pest management by deploying chemical insecticides at massive scales. The application of these chemicals causes pests to develop resistances, requiring the application of higher concentrations and varieties of pesticides for them to remain effective.1 This practice has caused significant harm to many other types of insects, such as bees, creating an urgent need for alternatives. One of the most successful alternatives is biological pest control, or biological IPM.

#### Main text

Biological pest control is the use of biological control agents (BCAs), such as natural predators, and entomopathogenic bacteria and viruses, to mitigate damage from pests without requiring the deployment of harmful chemicals. This paper will focus on the use of biological pest control against insect pests, particularly aphids, though it is also effective against harmful fungi, microbes, and other animals. By selectively introducing organisms, the trophic interactions of local ecosystems can be engineered to significantly diminish the population of pest species, while avoiding harm to others.2.5

#### Conclusion

Biological pest control has the potential to completely replace chemical pesticides in agriculture, particularly in controlled-environment growing. The volume of research on the subject has vastly increased in recent years, revealing new approaches that take advantage of recent advances in genetics to design and effectively select biological pest agents.2.20 In the face of climate change, biological pest control can help mitigate pest-related damage while maintaining the health and biodiversity of ecosystems.

## Introduction

Agricultural pests are organisms that feed on crops, degrading the production and quality of those crops in the process. Types of pests include arthropods (such as insects), mollusks, some vertebrates, and phytopathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Agricultural pests were responsible for a 40% reduction in crop yields in 2020.1 A significant portion of this damage comes from plant pathogens that were spread between plants by insect pests.3 Pest management is the term used for techniques designed to mitigate the damage caused my plant pests, by reducing their effectiveness or diminishing their populations.

Traditionally, insect pest management has been done through the application of entomotoxic chemicals to vulnerable plants, typically via spraying. The use of these chemical pesticides has been driven by their low cost, ease of application, and high short-term effectiveness. However, insects are prone to developing resistance to these chemicals, requiring increased concentration and more potent toxins for them to remain effective. This has resulted in many populations of pests developing resistance to one or more classes of insecticides in as many as 80% of cases.1 In addition, the use of insecticides in agriculture causes significant ecological harm to non-pest insect species and some vertebrate species. For example, the use of neonicotinoids has been linked to colony collapse disorder in bees, and the formerly-widespread pesticide DDT was banned after it was discovered that it caused major developmental issues in the eggs of birds of prey. Many pesticides have also been banned because they cause direct harm to humans. The frequent banning of dangerous insecticides and development of resistance in pests has decreased the effectiveness of chemical pesticides as a whole, prompting a need for more sustainable methods for mitigating damage from plant pests.

## Main text

Organic pest control methods, referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM), are pest control methods which don’t rely on the use of chemical pesticides. For example, one such method is physical pest management, wherein pests are mechanically removed, typically by submerging plants or using high pressure water streams. Other types of IPM include genetic (pest-resistant plants), cultural (climate and nutrition), and biological methods. Biological IPM is a form of organic pest management that relies on introducing organisms into the local ecosystem that will diminish populations of plant pests.2.38 These organisms are referred to as biological pest control agents. The two primary types of organisms that are introduced to manage insect pests are their natural predators, and pathogenic microbes. If selected carefully based on the type of pest and the nature of their infestation, biological pest control agents are extremely effective at reducing pest populations. The species of biological pest control agents have co-evolved with pest species for millions of years, enhancing their pest control abilities over time. As a result, many of them are highly specialized for particular species of pest, which significantly decreases the risk of collateral damage to non-pest species.

Feeding relations between different populations within an ecosystem are referred to as trophic interactions. Trophic interactions between plants and the animals that directly consume them form the foundation of all complex ecosystems. In these interactions, plants are referred to as primary producers, and the organisms which directly consume them are referred to as primary consumers. The majority of agricultural pests act as primary consumers. Trophic interactions can also be used to explain feeding interactions between consumers. Organisms which predate upon primary consumers are referred to as secondary consumers. Organisms which predate upon secondary consumers are referred to as tertiary consumers, and so on. Due to the inefficiency of digestion, energy use in predation, and other factors, consumers need to consume prey equivalent to many times their own biomass in order to sustain themselves. Individuals which can sustain themselves more efficiently are more likely to reproduce than others within their population. This results in significant selective pressure, driving these species to evolve over time to become more effective at feeding, regardless of whether they consume plants or other consumers.2.2 This same principle applies to nearly all other forms of life.

One example of a trophic interaction is the feeding relationship between insect pests, such as aphids, and the plants that they parasitize or consume. This trophic relationship between insect pests and their plant hosts is the primary means of survival for these pest species. Because of this, they have developed many adaptations that make them much more effective parasites. Insect pests have developed very efficient feeding behaviors, providing as much energy as possible while expending the smallest amount of energy. They also tend to have very high reproductive rates, with the potential to drastically increase their populations over short periods of time. Aphids are particularly virile because they are capable of asexual reproduction. Nearly all aphids are female, and are capable of self-fertilization for many generations. Males only develop during particular times of year, and when their populations are at or above the carrying capacity of the plant they infest. This comes at the cost of low genetic diversity, which makes their populations particularly susceptible to pathogens and predation.2.3

#### Methods of biological pest control

Biological pest control agents can be divided into predators and pathogens. Predators are organisms which consume other organisms to sustain themselves. Compared to pathogenic pest control agents, they are less specialized, and generally feed on a wide variety of prey species. Because of their more general survival ability, they are more likely to become invasive species when imported to regions where they are not native. However, their generalist nature allows them to remain effective across multiple different life cycle stages of pest species. They are also very effective at controlling populations of pest species with no parasitoid.2.16 Many species of entophagous arthropods have proven very effective at controlling pest populations in isolated environments, such as greenhouses, where there is generally only one predator and one prey species. However, it is unclear whether they are capable of controlling pest populations in fields, where there are a variety of pests and competition between different predatory insects.2.16 Specialized herbivorous species of insects, worms, and some mammals have also been shown to be effective at controlling plant pests, while not causing harm to agrarian plants.2.17

Secondary consumer predator species have to engage in active feeding methods to capture prey. Hunting is a complex task, which creates significant selective pressure for predatory species to develop efficient hunting methods. In order to increase their effectiveness, most predatory species use intelligent tactics to bypass the natural defenses of their prey. Some aphids are capable of excreting toxic fluid from their cornicles, which can harm organisms that attempt to consume them. One common way that predators avoid this is by using ambush tactics. These tactics rely on the predator’s high mobility, and ability to observe their prey to decide upon the best route of attack. Flying aphidophagous insects, such as lacewings and ladybirds, attack quickly from above, dealing lethal damage before the aphids can produce enough toxins to harm the predator. Spiders of the Salticidae family, also known as jumping spiders, are also ambush predators. They have developed the ability to dramatically increase the blood pressure in their hind limbs in order to propel themselves forwards at high speeds towards unsuspecting prey. They also have excellent vision, allowing them to study their prey from long distances to plan their attacks.  

Pathogens which infect insects are the other primary type of biological control agent against pest species. These include bacteria, viruses, fungi, mites, and other microbes which parasitize off of insect pests like aphids. On a trophic level, these pathogens have a similar relationship with insect pests as insect pests do with the plants that they parasitize. The mechanisms that they use to spread between and cause harm to individual hosts vary depending on the type of organism used. One of the most effective types of bacterial pest control agents is _Bacillus thuringiensis_ (Bt), whose spores produce crystals with insecticidal properties. Outside of the insect, they are non-toxic, but when ingested, the insects’ own digestive enzymes convert it into endotoxin. This toxin has a similar mechanism of action to many pesticides, and leads to the death of affected insects through internal bleeding. Because the toxins are only activated once they are inside the pests, they pose very little threat to other organisms. In order to cause harm, the host has to both have digestive enzymes that are capable of activating it, and be susceptible to the toxin. Several beneficial insect species have been found to be resistant to the effects of endotoxin.1, 2.21 Because of its high selectivity, it’s very effective as a targeted biological pest control agent.

Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have also proven to be very effective biological pest control agents. They are fungi that grow on and within insects, eventually leading to the death of the host insect. They have become more popular as a pest control treatment in recent years because of their high target-specificity, self-perpetuity, and safety.3 Similar to entomopathogenic bacteria, EPF are highly selective, each infecting some particular group of insects while not harming others. Several species of EPF specialize on infecting insect pests, but do not infect the natural enemies of those pests. EPF also are much more persistent than other forms of biological pest control.3, 2.24 They release spores from the surface of their host insects, which can then infect other members of the same or similar species. EPF are particularly effective in crowded insect communities with low genetic diversity, such as large populations of aphids infesting a single plant. Pest species have not been found to develop any resistance to EPF after prolonged usage, particularly in those that infect pest species with low genetic diversity. They are capable of spreading to the entire pest population, eventually resulting in local extinction. Because EPF rely on particular elements of insect biology in order to grow and survive, they pose no threat to humans. They are highly specialized, and only capable of infecting a small range of species, making them ideal for use alongside arthropod predators and parasites in pest control. Several aphid-specific EPF do not infect insect predators or parasites that come into contact with or consume them, even when those insects are other hemipterans (true bugs). When compared to pesticides such as Imidacloprid, it’s been found that a combination of organic neem oil and entomopathogenic fungi has a far lesser impact on the populations of aphidophagous spiders and beetles, while still being effective at controlling insect pest populations. This combination of EPF and neem oil has been found to reduce the populations of Jassids (A phytoparasitic species of grasshopper) by up to 65%, and populations of whitefly by up to 50%, with low rates of recovery between subsequent sprays. All experimental groups of plants in this study were also inhabited by predatory ladybird beetles and jumping spiders, who did not experience any significant population loss compared to the control.3

The most important factor in the effectiveness of biological pest control is the proper selection of biological pest control agents. For full effectiveness, organisms which are effective predators or pathogens of the target pest species must be used. Care must also be taken in order to reduce collateral damage. It is important to select organisms which will have little impact on non-target species, such as beneficial insects, mycorrhizal biota, or the plants themselves.2.5 This can be most easily done in controlled environments. Isolated environments such as greenhouses have much smaller, more self-contained ecosystems. This makes it easier to understand which organisms are present, and determine their trophic relationships. In closed ecosystems, some pests are more virulent than they are in fields because they have little competition or natural enemies. However, this makes biological pest control much more effective.2.31 Highly specialized BCAs can be deployed to attack the particular pest or pests that are present in the closed environment. Less specialized BCAs such as insect predators can also be used, and can remove pests more effectively than they can in field environments.2.16 Because of the reduced environment size, their ability to search for prey is improved, and they are often capable of locating every individual pest.

The need for biological pest control methods to replace chemical pest control methods is driven by increasing pesticide resistance in plant pests. The intense selective pressure produced by chemical pesticides drives rapid evolution of pesticide resistance in insect pests. This has led many to attempt to supplement chemical pest control methods with biological pest control methods. However, hybrid approaches have been very ineffective, because the use of chemical pest control almost completely eliminates the activity of biological control agents. Natural enemies of pest species are 30 times less likely to develop resistance to pesticides than pest species.2.24 Insect predators and pathogens die out, leading to further pest activity. 2.13 This typically results in large-scale resurgence of pest populations shortly after the application of pesticides. It also creates population spikes of non-pest organisms, which can become secondary pests at high enough concentrations.

## Conclusion

Biological pest management has been proven as an effective mechanism for mitigating damage from plant pests, though it is still a relatively new field with many gaps in knowledge and opportunities for further development. Its deployment as a full replacement for traditional chemical pesticides is a high priority. Biological pest control has been shown to be effective at completely or partially mitigating pest populations in more than 60% of cases,2.41 while causing significantly less collateral damage than chemical pesticides. More research is required to adapt biological control methods to effectively mitigate damage caused by increasingly common invasive pest species, and to conserve the trophic relationships between pests and their natural enemies. The current primary limitation in deploying biological pest management is the requirement of long-term study of target environments to understand their ecosystems on the population level. Biological pest control methods will continue to advance in the coming years, providing new insights and developing into an effective replacement for traditional pesticides.
