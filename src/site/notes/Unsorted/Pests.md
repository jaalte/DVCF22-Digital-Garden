## In a controlled environment

## Factors
- Seeds are one of the most nutritious things on Earth


## Types of Insect pests

### Aphids
### Spider mites
- Can remain dormant for years without infesting a plant
- Can travel through mesh screens
### Whitefly
- Tropical, needs a tropical environment
	- Can't survive cold winters, so they try to infest indoor growing areas
### Mealy bug
- Can live on pots for a long time
### Scale
- Type of insect that produces a very hard shell
- Only vulnerable to pest control for a short window
	- Stay dormant until spring
	- Can be detected by checking sticky tape traps
	- Drown them with an inert oil
	- After this window, they begin sucking, become permanently sessile, and secrete a hard shell that is hermetically sealed and very resistant
- Some wasps can penetrate their shells for oviposition

### Ants


#### Biological prevention measures

## Fungal pests

#### 3 General requirements for a pathogen
- Presence of the pathogen
- Right environmental conditions
- Susceptibility

#### Powdery mildew
- Greyish mold on plant leaves
- Properties
	- Many specialized species
		- Most only target a small group of plants
- Early signs:
	- Yellow splotches on leaves
- Seasonal conditions:
	- Warm days, cool nights
	- Prefers light moisture
- Preventative measures
	- Dried milk






### Eggplant
- Whitefly, aphids, spidermites

## Weeds
- Some are poisonous
	- eg. poison hemlock, has 
- Dandelions
	- Edible
	- Can be made into coffee substitute
	- Good in salads, similar to butter lettuce
- English daisy
	- Perrennial, edible 
- Shepherd's purse
	- Seed packets pop open and spread seeds all over the place
- Henbit
	- Annual, full sun, good in salads
	- Not drought tolerant so less common than it used to be
- Common mallow
	- Bay area perrennial
	- Edible flowers
	- Pull in spring or spray with vinegar
- Clover
	- Will be outcompeted by grass if the grass gets enough nitrogen
- Common groundsel
	- Looks like a dandelion
	- All parts are toxic to most animals

#### Weed management
- Pulling
- Spraying
- Flaming
- Steaming
	- Same mechanism as flaming
