## Earth is a collection of materials and systems

- **Materials**
	- Rocks
	- Minerals
	- Magma
- **Systems:**
	- Plate tectonics
	- Erosion
		- Weathering mechanically and chemically breaks down rocks
		- Then erosion disperses those fragments
	- [[Unsorted/Volcanism\|Volcanism]]
	- The [[hydrosphere\|hydrosphere]]
- **Biogeochemical cycles:**
	- Hydrosphere
	- Atmosphere
	- Biosphere
	- Geosphere
