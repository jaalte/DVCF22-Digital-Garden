- Harm to [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]]
	- BT Corn is in almost all processed foods
		- Modified to produce the Cry proteins that make [[Unsorted/Bacillus thurigiensis\|Bacillus thurigiensis]] lethal to insects
		- Will take decades of research to definitively determine if Bt corn is harmful to [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]]
	- Evidence for
		- Michelle
			- Creates micro-tears in [[Unsorted/Humans\|human]] digestive tract, weakening immune system
			- Possibly responsible for massive increase in allergies in recent [[Unsorted/Humans\|human]] generations
	- Evidence againstalimentary canal
		- "Other organisms (including [[Unsorted/Humans\|humans]], other animals and non-targeted insects) that lack the appropriate receptors in their gut cannot be affected by the _cry_ protein, and therefore are not affected by Bt"
