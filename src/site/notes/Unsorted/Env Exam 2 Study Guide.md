BIOSC 170 STUDY GUIDE EXAM 2  

---
#### [[Unsorted/Niches\|Niche]] concepts
- [x] ***Be familiar with the two general types of species niche Generalist and Specialist***
- ***What is a niche? Be able to describe some factors that shape why species live where they live.***
	- A niche is the combination of a habitat that a species can live in, and the role it plays in that habitat
	- Can also be thought of as a set of sources for resources that an organism needs to survive
- ***Be familiar with the competitive exclusion principle.***
	- It is difficult for new species to enter occupied niches since existing species are already better adapted than them.
- ***What is resource partitioning and how does it relate to the ecological niche?***  
	- Different species will specialize in different forms of a particular limited resource they all need in order to avoid competition
- ***Why is the niche concept important when thinking about global change?***
	- Niches are the fundamental unit of survival. The quality of the niches that an organism occupies determine its survival ability
