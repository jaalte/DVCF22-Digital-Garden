## The process by which all forms of [[Unsorted/Life\|life]] use chemical energy to power their biological processes

- The inverse process of [[Unsorted/Photosynthesis\|Photosynthesis]]
- The potential energy contained within the bonds of organic molecules is released through oxidation...
	- ...to drive the production of ATP, the chemical which mediates energy in all cellular processes
- Subject to the first law of thermodynamics:
	- Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change form
- One component of [[Metabolism\|Metabolism]]
	- Along with converting food to structural material
	- ...and eliminating metabolic wastes


## Respiration (Aerobic)

$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 â†’ 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + Energy(ATP) + Heat$$

- Occurs in mitochondria, [[Unsorted/Endosymbiotes\|Endosymbiotes]] present in all eukaryotic cells which perform aerobic respiration

## Respiration (Anaerobic)
