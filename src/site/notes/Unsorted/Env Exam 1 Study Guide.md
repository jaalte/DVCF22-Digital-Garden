		- autotrophs/producers:
			- What are they & how they get their energy?
				- Organisms like plants and cyanobacteria
				- They produce their own food through photosynthesis, using light energy
		- heterotrophs/consumers:
			- What are they and where do they get their energy?
				- Organisms like animals and fungi, they get their energy by consuming other organisms
	- What is respiration? What is photosynthesis (know the reactants and products of photosynthesis). Know how these two processes are related
		- Respiration is the process by which glucose is used by organisms to perform useful work
		- It is the reciprocal of photosynthesis
	- What is net primary productivity?
		- When there's leftover chemical potential energy after plant respiration
		- Without it, consumers cannot be sustained
	- What is the difference between how energy vs. nutrients move through ecosystems?
		- Energy moves through the ecosystem quite quickly, being absorbed as light and released as heat
		- Nutrients are perpetually recycled through biogeochemical cycles
	- What are biogeochemical cycles?
		- Processes by which nutrients and natural resources are cycled through different pools within the environment
	- What is a source? Sink? Flux? Pool?
		- A source is a pool that releases more than it consumes
		- A sink is a pool that takes in more of a resource than it releases
		- Flux is the movement of a resource between pools
		- Pools / reservoirs are places where a resource accumulates
	- What is a trophic level? Trophic interaction?
		- A trophic level is a tier of a food chain/pyramid
		- A trophic interaction is when an organism of a higher trophic level consumes organisms of a lower trophic level

	- What are decomposers and why are they important?
		- They recycle materials within ecosystems
	- Know what a food pyramid shows. What does a food pyramid show that is not shown by a food chain?
		- Decomposers release nutrients from dead biomass back into the environment
		- They consume material from all trophic levels
	- Understand energy transfer and energy loss through food chains: what is the direction of energy movement and how much energy is lost between each level of a food chain?
		- ✔
		- About 90% of energy is lost at each level of a food chain

		- ✔
	- What is bioaccumulation? What is biomagnification? Be able to explain **how toxins biomagnify** up the food chain?
		- Bioaccumulation is when an organism consumes more of a toxin than they naturally dissapate
		- Biomagnification is how organisms at higher trophic levels consume ~10x the volume of toxins that organisms at the previous level have comsumed, potentially leading to bioaccumulation
- **Water, Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus Cycle**
	- How is the water on earth partitioned, what portion of it is freshwater? What proportion of freshwater is readily available for human use?
		- 95% is in the oceans
		- 2.5% is freshwater, and of that:

			- 30% is groundwater
			- 70% is in ice caps
	- How does water move through ecosystems, where is water stored, what processes move water around ecosystems?
		- Most water moves around through evaporation, transpiration, and precipitation
		- Most water is in the oceans
			- Freshwater is stored in rivers, reservoirs, groundwater, and ice deposits
	- How do plants mediate the water cycle?
		- Plants chemically consume water through photosynthesis
		- They also release some water through transpirational loss
	- How are the water and carbon cycles linked?
		- Plants are a major carbon sink, and without enough water they can't survive to do that.
	- How have humans altered the carbon cycle?
		- We have mined carbon-rich materials, and released them as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
		- Deforestation has released a lot of sequestered CO2

	- Why is nitrogen important for living things? (where is it found?)
		- Part of DNA and proteins
	- How have humans altered the nitrogen cycle?
		- By using nitrogen-rich fertilizers we've doubled the amount of bioavailable nitrogen in the ecosystem
	- Why is phosphorous important for living things? (where is it found?)
		- It's an essential component of DNA and ATP
	- Where is phosphorous found?
		- It's found in rocks, and is extracted via erosion and human activity
	- How have humans altered the phosphorous cycle?
		- We've mined phosphates and used them to fertilize plants, increasing the amount circulating
	- What is eutrophication and how does it work?
		- Eutrophication happens when algae blooms caused by an excess of nitrogen compounds due to overfertilization
		- They die out after, and their decomposition sucks all the oxygen out of the water, killing other organisms.
- **Photosynthesis and Respiration**
	- What was the composition of our Atmosphere 4 billion years ago? What happened around 2.5 billion years ago to shift the atmospheric composition?
		- Very different than today's atmosphere

		- Aerobic respiration
			- C6H12O6 (glucose) + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + ATP + heat
	- Where does photosynthesis occur?
		- In the leaves of plants, within the chloroplasts of their cells.
	- What happens when a plant opens it’s stomata (in terms of what enters the leaf tissue and what escapes)?
		- CO2 enters the leaf, and O2 leaves it. Some water is also lost
	- How do plants mediate the water cycle
