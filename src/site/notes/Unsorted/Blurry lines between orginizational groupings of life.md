## Blurry lines
- Individuals
	- PANDO!!
		- All grown from the same organism, but if roots are severed they still can survive independently
	- [[Unsorted/Fungi#Mushrooms\|Mushrooms]]
		- Very hard to tell which mushrooms belong to which mycelium if there are multiple of same species
			- maybe they merge??
- Population
	- Corals, which do mass-spawning, wherein a large number of corals in one area will eject gametes all at once
	- Depends on definition of what a *species* is anyways
	- Genetic exchange
		- AKA gene flow
		- Individuals from one population can meet and interbreed
		- Introduces new traits and increases [[Unsorted/Biodiversity\|Biodiversity]]
	- Trends in populations is a very common point of study in ecology
