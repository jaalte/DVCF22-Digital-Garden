- The source of all novel variations
	- MUCH slower than the others
- Happen at random
- Have to occur in reproductive cells to be heritable
	- ***Somatic mutations:*** Non-heritable mutations
	- ***Germmline mutations***: Heritable mutations
- Can have a wide range of effects
	- No effect
		- May be in unused DNA
		- or in a protein-coding region, without changing the amino acid
	- Detrimental
		- Any that harm an organism's ability to survive and reproduce
		- Genetic disorders
		- Can be deadly or just detrimental
	- Beneficial
		- Helpful for the organism
		- Rare compared to no/detrimental effects
- Sources of mutations
	- Replication errors in DNA
		- Rare mistakes in copying DNA during cell division
		- Can also be caused by the breakdown of DNA
	- External influences
		- Exposure to specific chemicals or radiation
		- Cells have mechanisms to repair this damage, but aren't perfect
- Mutations in plants
	- Spontaneous mutations can occur in individual branches in plants
	- Seeds and cuttings produced by these branches are often capable of inheriting the trait
