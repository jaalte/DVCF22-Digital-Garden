**Course Description:**

`	`This is an introductory course that is organized historically around the theme of Hell.  This class will engage in a historical and cross-cultural analysis of how poets, philosophers, theologians and artists have dealt with the dark side of human nature and represented life after death, guilt and responsibility, trial and redemption, and personal growth and enlightenment.  Our exploration of this topic will involve examples of literature, philosophy, art, architecture, sculpture, music and film from international sources.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Course Objectives/Student Learning Objectives:**  By the end of this course, students should be able to:

A. Analyze literary and philosophical texts and identify what they say about the concept of hell.

B. Identify key elements of the visual arts, music and film and relate them to broad historical and cultural concepts.

C. Compare and contrast ideas of the afterlife across cultures and historical periods.

\6)  Final Exam				    	      12/7			20%

Unless you opt for Pass/No Pass, the grading standards break down like this:

Letter Grade		Percentage of Total Points

`        `A				90-100%

`        `B				80-89%

`        `C				70-79%

`        `D				60-69%

`        `F				0-59%

**1)  Discussion Boards and Participation**

`	`The main method of participation in our class will be the Discussion Boards via the ‘Discussion’ section of our Canvas page.  There will be a new Discussion prompt posted every week, and all students are expected to respond to it in a focused, thoughtful way (with a 150 word minimum post).  The Discussion prompt will be oriented towards the readings, lectures, and other relevant material for that week, and students will need to be familiar with those things before making their contribution.  In addition to their own (150 word minimum) contribution, students will ALSO be expected to respond (again, in a focused and clear manner) to a post from one of their fellow students (50 word minimum).

`	`The Discussion Boards will open on Mondays and remain open all week until Friday at midnight, when it will close (and no further student contributions will be allowed for that week’s DB after that).  Participation of students as reflected in these Discussion Boards will account for 10% of the total grade for the class.

**2)  Reaction Papers**

Students are required to submit 5 different Reaction Papers for this class, due on 5 different Fridays throughout the term.  There will be several Reaction Paper prompt options offered each week posted in the ‘Assignments’ section of our Canvas page---often emphasizing the integrative aspects of the Humanities---and students should choose and respond to only one of the options for that week.  These Reaction Papers need to be *at least* 200 words and they should directly and thoughtfully respond to one of the writing prompts.  New prompt options will be made available on Monday for each week, and students will upload their Reaction Papers in that same ‘Assignments’ file before Fridays at midnight.  No late Reaction Papers will be accepted, so it is vital that students submit their contributions before the Friday midnight deadline for that week.  Note that reposting the prompt does NOT apply to the word count minimums.

Each of these Reaction Papers is worth 2% of credit and, taken together, they will account for 10% of the total grade for the class.

**3)  Quizzes**

`	`There will be three quizzes for this class, scheduled for the Fridays of Week #4 (9/14), Week #8 (10/12), and Week #12 (11/9), each one comprising 10% of the final grade for the course (30% total).  Students are required to take these Quizzes on those dates, but it is entirely up to them when on those Fridays they take it.  The Quizzes will be available via the ‘Quizzes’ section of our Canvas page, and each student will have 30 minutes to complete it.  These are designed to test the comprehension and depth of the student’s understanding of the material covered in class via lecture, as well as the assigned readings.  A Study Guide will be provided by the instructor the week before each Quiz.  As a policy, there are no make-up quizzes unless there is verifiable documentation about a personal or medical emergency.

**4)  Paper Thesis, Title & Bibliography**

`	`To help develop and clarify the Writing Assignment, each student will turn in a Paper Thesis, Title and Bibliography.  The thesis should spell out exactly what the larger Writing Assignment is going to achieve:  identifying a specific artistic or intellectual product that depicts Hell, and developing a clear, provable interpretive claim about it (or at least showing how it is a creation of a specific time and place).  In addition to a clear, provable, integrative thesis statement, the four sources that the ideas are based on should also be included in proper bibliographical format, as well as a coherent title (one that identifies the specific topic under consideration as well as offers your interpretive ‘take’ on it).  If one has chosen a primary text as the basis of their project, then only that one source is necessary as a reference.  Instructor feedback on this project will be provided within one week of it being submitted.

`	`This Paper Thesis and Bibliography must be submitted in the appropriate Module of our Canvas page prior to midnight on 10/19, and accounts for 10% of the total grade for the course.

**5)  Writing Assignment**

`	`In a short, original, thesis-driven typewritten essay (2,500 words minimum), analyze a specific artistic or intellectual product that depicts Hell.  A strong thesis is essential for this project; at the very least, the paper should revolve around a clear, provable claim about the Hell product in terms of its genre, or the historical, cultural, political, religious origins or values of the time (that is, discuss how it is a creation of ‘a specific time and place’).  Students are encouraged to speak with the instructor about appropriate topics and texts---at least four academically appropriate sources should be used---and primary sources are particularly encouraged.  Though short in length, the final paper is expected to be a very polished, formal college-level essay (with full bibliography, footnotes/endnotes, title page, etc.).  An excellent resource for the formal components of college level papers can be found at the Purdue University OWL website (https://**owl**.english.**purdue**.edu/**owl**/).

This paper must be submitted in the ‘Assignments’ section of Canvas by midnight on 11/16, and is worth 20% of the total grade for the course.

**6)  Final Exam**

`	`A comprehensive Final Exam is scheduled for Friday, 12/7, worth 20% of the total grade for the course.  The exam will be comprised of both objective and essay portions.  A Study Guide will be provided by the instructor before the Exam.  As with the Quizzes, the Exam must be taken on that Friday, though it can be taken at any point during that day.  Students will have 60 minutes to complete the Exam, and it will close at midnight on 12/7.  As a policy, there are no make-up exams for the Final except for documented medical or equivalent personal emergencies.

**Classroom Expectations:**

`	`-The instructor will make every reasonable effort to help all students complete this class successfully---with a passing grade---and to help them achieve their academic goals, though you must also be a very active participant in this process.  Students who are struggling with the material or course requirements are welcome to see me during my office hours for assistance and support, or to obtain a referral to additional on- or off-campus resources.

`	`-Often, college classes will engage you with controversial topics.  It is not important for all of us to agree all the time.  It is important for everyone to feel that they can respectfully dialogue with each other.  As we develop our academic conversations, please take care to do so politely.

`	`-I expect we’ll have a great class; however, if issues arise that disrupt our classroom culture, I may ask you to conference with me first, and then we can take it up to the Dean of Students (if needed).  Disorderly conduct or any type of harassment are grounds for removal from class.  To learn more, please read DVC [Student Rights & Responsibilities](https://www.dvc.edu/communication/policies/student-rights/index.html).

-Students should be familiar with the DVC’s Academic Honesty Policies, which are essential for the integrity of the college.  Among other things, plagiarism in any form---the representation of someone else’s words or ideas as one’s own---will result in an instant failing grade for the project (other penalties may also be enforced; e.g., a required meeting with a representative of the VP of Student Services).  If you have questions about what constitutes plagiarism, PLEASE speak with the instructor BEFORE you submit any assignment.
